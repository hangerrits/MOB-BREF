    "full_text": "1. BAT is to implement and adhere to an Environmental Management System \n \nA number of environmental management techniques are determined as BAT. The scope \n(e.g. level of detail) and nature of the EMS (e.g. standardised or non-standardised) will \ngenerally be related to the nature, scale and complexity of the installation, and the range of \nenvironmental impacts it may have. \n \nAn Environmental Management System (EMS) incorporates, as appropriate to individual \ncircumstances, the following features: \n \n•\ndefinition of an environmental policy for the installation by top management (commitment \nof the top management is regarded as a precondition for a successful application of other \nfeatures of the EMS) \n•\nplanning and establishing the necessary procedures \n•\nimplementation of the procedures, paying particular attention to \n−\nstructure and responsibility \n−\ntraining, awareness and competence \n−\ncommunication \n−\nemployee involvement \n−\ndocumentation \n−\nefficient process control \n−\nmaintenance programme \n−\nemergency preparedness and response \n−\nsafeguarding compliance with environmental legislation. \n•\nchecking performance and taking corrective action, paying particular attention to \n−\nmonitoring and measurement (see also [32, European Commission, 2003]) \n−\ncorrective and preventive action \n−\nmaintenance of records \n−\nindependent (where practicable) internal auditing in order to determine whether or not \nthe environmental management system conforms to planned arrangements and has \nbeen properly implemented and maintained. \n•\nreview by top management. \n\nChapter 13 \nPolymers \n\nThree further features, which can complement the above stepwise, are considered as supporting \nmeasures. However, their absence is generally not inconsistent with BAT. These three \nadditional steps are: \n \n•\nhaving the management system and audit procedure examined and validated by an \naccredited certification body or an external EMS verifier \n•\npreparation and publication (and possibly external validation) of a regular environmental \nstatement describing all the significant environmental aspects of the installation, allowing \nfor year-by-year comparison against environmental objectives and targets as well as with \nsector benchmarks as appropriate \n \n•\nimplementation and adherence to an internationally accepted voluntary system such as \nEMAS and EN ISO 14001:1996. This voluntary step could give higher credibility to the \nEMS. In particular EMAS, which embodies all the above-mentioned features, gives higher \ncredibility. However, non-standardised systems can in principle be equally effective \nprovided that they are properly designed and implemented. \n \nSpecifically for the polymer industry, it is also important to consider the following potential \nfeatures of the EMS: \n \n•\nthe environmental impact from the eventual decommissioning of the unit at the stage of \ndesigning a new plant \n•\nthe development of cleaner technologies \n•\nwhere practicable, the application of sectoral benchmarking on a regular basis, including \nenergy efficiency and energy conservation activities, choice of input materials, emissions \nto air, discharges to water, consumption of water and generation of waste.",
