Operating these cooling systems has certain environmental\nconsequences. The level and character of the environmental impact varies depending on the\ncooling principle and the way these systems are operated. To minimise this impact an\n“approach” can be followed which aims at prevention of emissions by proper design and\nselection of techniques.\nWithin the framework of IPPC, cooling should be considered as an integrated part of the overall\nenergy management of an industrial process. The intention should be to reuse superfluous heat\nof one process in other parts of the same process or in different processes on site in order to\nminimise the need for discharge of waste heat into the environment. This will affect the overall\nenergy efficiency of a process and reduce the demand for cooling, for the required capacity of\nthe system and for its operational demands. The optimisation of energy efficiency, however, is a\ncomplex exercise and regarded as highly process-specific and as such beyond the scope of this\nhorizontal document. If there are no options for reuse on-site, this does not have to lead\nautomatically to discharge of heat into the environment, but options for reuse off-site in\nindustrial or civil applications may be considered. In the end, if options for reuse of heat cannot\nbe exploited any further, discharge of superfluous heat into the environment is to be considered.\nOnce the level of heat to be removed has been assessed, a first selection of the appropriate\nsystem for cooling can be decided upon. Much of the environmental performance due to the\noperation of a cooling system can be influenced by proper design and by selection of the right\nmaterial taking into account the process requirements and local aspects. It is reported that 80%\nof cooling system performance has already been determined at the design table and 20% by the\nway the cooling system is operated (so-called 80/20 rule). Many different factors need balancing\nin assessing what is BAT (best available techniques) for the reduction of the environmental\nimpact of cooling. Right from the start it is important to realise that a cooling system is an\nauxiliary, but generally crucial and integrated system for an industrial process and that every\nchange applied to the process of cooling may potentially affect the performance of the industrial\nor manufacturing process to be cooled.\nTherefore, the integrated assessment of the consumption and emissions of cooling systems and\nthe decision on the application of a cooling technique both should be made in the light of the\ntotal environmental performance of the plant and within the requirements of the process to be\ncooled, ultimately balanced with costs. The required level of cooling must be guaranteed, with\nminimal consequences for the environment. The required level of cooling is process-specific.\nWhere some processes can tolerate a certain temporary rise in process temperature, other more\ntemperature sensitive processes might not, as this will have a large impact on the environmental\nperformance of the whole plant.\nAccording to IPPC, the environmental performance of the cooling systems discussed in this\nBREF must be improved by applying BAT. The question is if and how BAT for cooling\nsystems can be determined in a general sense, where the final determination on what is best is\ncertainly a local matter answering the specific requirements of process, environment and\neconomics. To structure and in some way simplify the complex process of determination of\nBAT, this document follows the “approach” described above and presented in Figure 1.1. This\n“approach” should lead to a balanced decision on the application of a system for cooling and on\nits optimisation based on BAT for both new and existing situations.\nThe BAT concept consists of the following steps aiming at reduction of emissions and\nminimisation of the environmental impact:\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n• \nreduce the final level of waste heat produced, considering options for reuse;\n• \ndefine process requirements;\n• \nconsider general site conditions;\n• \nassess environmental requirements:\n- \noptions for minimisation of resource consumption\n- \noptions for reduction of emissions\n• \ndevelop system operation (maintenance, monitoring and risk prevention)\n• \napply economic requirements\nIn Figure 1.1, the BAT “approach” is presented in a schematic way showing the most relevant\nfactors involved in the determination of BAT for industrial cooling systems. For the sake of\nclarity not all links that can possibly be made between different aspects of cooling have been\nadded in this scheme. For example, there is a link between sound attenuation measures and the\nreduction of specific direct energy consumption; and the achievable minimum end temperature\nof a cooling system is limited by the local climatic conditions.\nIn the following sections the BAT ”approach” will be further discussed in the light of common\nprinciples of operating industrial cooling systems and, where possible, indicating what the\napplication of BAT means in the spirit of the IPPC-Directive. By its nature, this optimisation\ncannot be an exact mathematical comparison of various solutions. The optimisation process\nincludes a similar challenge for all environmental balances, as it requires a comparison of\ndifferent environmental impacts and a decision about which ones are the least severe or most\nacceptable. Nevertheless, the suggested BAT “approach” aims at providing significant\ninformation on the implications of various solutions for the environment, on costs and risks as\nwell as the influencing factors. Based on this information, a decision can be made which is\nmuch more justified than just concentrating on optimising one single factor (e.g. water intake,\nenergy consumption, plume or noise emission etc.).\nExamples will be given to indicate the direction of the changes, rather than to specify particular\nemissions or reductions. Where appropriate, data are shown or reference is made to the annexes,\nbut for most of the factors involved, data on resource use and on emissions of cooling systems\nare either limited or they are too specific to be generally applicable.\nSummarising, the assessment of a cooling system, balancing the different factors, is founded on\nthe following points:\n• \nthe requirements of the process to be cooled take precedence over the measures for\nreduction of the environmental impact of a cooling system;\n• \napplying the BAT “approach” is not aiming at a disqualification of any of the configurations\ndescribed in Chapter 2;\n• \nthe BAT “approach” has more freedom for optimisation and prevention of emissions in the\ndesign phase in case of new installations, but for existing installations design options should\nalso be considered;\n• \nconsequently, for existing plants it is expected that the BAT “approach” will start further\ndown in the consecutive assessment steps;\n• \na further distinction can be made between large custom-made cooling systems and smaller\nsystems (series product) with respect to the level of environmental impact;\n• \noptimisation should be seen as the application of design options, of reduction techniques\nand of good operator practice;\n• \nthe level of reduction of emissions resulting from the BAT “approach” is not predictable,\nbut depends on the demands placed on the cooling system;\n• \nthe BAT “approach” aims at cooling system operation balancing the requirements by the\nprocess to be cooled and by the local environmental objectives;\n• \nselection schemes are useful in making a balanced choice and\n• \nfinally each balanced result will have a certain environmental impact.\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n1.

Depending on the process,\nthis heat cannot always be fully recovered and/or re-used, but has to be removed from the\nprocess by cooling. The amount of non-recoverable heat can be called waste heat, and it needs\nto be transferred to the environment, as this serves as a heat sink. A number of processes with a\nspecifically high production of waste heat and a high demand for cooling are mentioned below.\nIn many processes different sources of waste heat exist and at different levels: high (above\n60 °C), medium (25-60°C), and low (10-25°C). Also, different processes with their specific\ndemand can be found within the same production site. Large cooling systems are used for large\ncombustion plants (power industry), in the chemical industry, refineries, the iron and steel\nindustry, the food industry, the pulp and integrated paper industry, incinerators and in the glass\nindustry.\nWithin a similar process cooling is applied for different purposes such as cooling of process\nsubstances in a heat exchanger, of pumps and compressors, of vacuum systems and of steam\nturbine condensers. The following major sources of waste heat can be distinguished with their\nrelated levels of waste heat.\n• \nFriction - by definition the transformation of mechanical energy into heat. Cooling systems\nfor these processes are usually indirect systems with oil as a primary coolant. Because oil is\nused as a cooling medium, the cooling system is sensitive to high temperatures. Therefore,\nthe average temperature of the waste heat is at medium level.\n• \nCombustion - the transformation of chemical energy by oxidation into heat. The waste heat\nlevel of combustion processes is variable.\n• \nExothermic Processes (chemical) - Many chemical processes are exothermic: chemical\nenergy is transformed into heat without any combustion. Exothermic processes are often\nvery sensitive to the efficiency of the removal of waste heat. The temperature level of the\nwaste heat is medium to high, depending on the process.\n• \nCompression - compressing a gas leads to the generation of heat. This heat usually has to be\nremoved as waste heat at a medium to high temperature level.\n• \nCondensation (thermodynamic cycles) - Many processes work on the principles of\nthermodynamic cycles. A liquid medium is evaporated, taking up energy, and is\nconsequently condensed, transforming rejected energy as heat. Thermodynamic systems are\nvery sensitive to temperature and the temperature level is medium to low.\nThe waste heat level is an important factor to be taken into account when selecting an industrial\ncooling system. Table 1.1 shows the temperature ranges of the medium to be cooled and the\nmost suitable cooling systems. The lower the waste heat level, the more difficult it is to cool\nwith dry air-cooled systems. In practice, air-cooling is often used for process temperatures\nabove about 60ºC. Heat levels above 100ºC are generally pre-cooled with air-coolers if no\noptions for reuse are available. Evaporative cooling is, in principle, often used to cool process\nflows with medium and low temperatures. For low temperatures also once-through systems are\nused, especially where large capacities are needed.\nThe ranges should not be taken as fixed when selecting a cooling system. For the high\ntemperature range 50ºC as well as the above-mentioned 60ºC is being used. Also, temperatures\ndepend largely on the local situation (climate and temperature of the coolant) and the potential\napplication of a system will vary accordingly. So, once-through systems are also applied at\nhigher temperature levels, provided that admissible discharge temperatures at the outlet into the\nreceiving water will not be exceeded. For processes to be operated throughout the year under\nvarying climatic conditions it can also be necessary to use a combination of different cooling\nsystems.\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 1.1: Heat temperature levels and application range\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nTemperature range\nSuitable Cooling System\nTypical Applications\nLow temperature\n(10 – 25 °C)\n• \nonce-through systems\n(direct/indirect)\n• \nwet cooling towers\n(mechanical/natural draught)\n• \nhybrid cooling towers\n• \ncombined cooling systems\n• \npower generation\n• \n(petro-) chemical processes\nMedium temperature\n(25 – 60 °C)\n• \nonce-through systems\n(direct/indirect)\n• \nwet cooling towers\n(mechanical/natural draught)\n• \nclosed circuit cooling towers\n• \nevaporative condensers\n• \nair-cooled fluid coolers\n• \nair-cooled condensers\n• \nhybrid cooling towers/ condensers\n• \nhybrid closed circuit cooling tower\n• \nrefrigeration cycles\n• \ncompressor\n• \ncooling of machines\n• \nautoclave cooling\n• \ncooling of rotary kilns\n• \nsteel plants\n• \ncement plants\n• \npower generation in warmer regions\n(Mediterranean)\nHigh Temperature\n(above 60 °C)\n• \nonce-through systems\n(direct/indirect) in special cases\n• \nwet cooling towers\n(mechanical/natural draught)\n• \nair-cooled fluid cooler/ condensers\n• \nwaste incineration plants\n• \nengine cooling\n• \ncooling of exhaust fumes\n• \nchemical processes\n1.2 Level of cooling system and influence on process\nefficiency\n1.2.1 Temperature sensitive applications\nMany chemical and industrial processes are temperature critical applications. The efficiency of\nthe process is sensitive to temperature and/or pressure and therefore correlated with the\nefficiency of the removal of waste heat. For these processes, the horizontal “approach” of best\navailable cooling technology is connected with the vertical “approach” of best available process\ntechnology. Examples for temperature critical applications are:\n• \npower generation,\n• \nthermodynamic cycles,\n• \nexothermic processes.\nIntegrated pollution prevention means that selection of best available cooling technology and\napplication of techniques, of treatments or ways of operating should consider not only the direct\nenvironmental impacts of the different cooling systems, but also the indirect environmental\nimpacts due to varying efficiencies of the different processes. It has to be decided at local level\nwhether should be pursued by focussing on the cooling system rather than on the production\nprocess. The increase of the indirect impacts can be considerably higher than the decrease of\ndirect impacts of the selected cooling system.\nPower plants (see Annex XII) are the most important source of waste heat. The transformation\nof fossil energy into electrical energy is connected with many of the waste heat generating\nprocesses mentioned in Section 1.1. Waste heat is generated during combustion, friction of the\nturbine, condensation of the steam and transformation of the electricity. A separate cooling\nwater system, for the auxiliary systems using oil or gas for smooth operation of equipment, also\ngenerates a small amount of waste heat. If the cooling requirement of the power generating\nsystem cannot be met, it immediately shows in a decrease of the overall efficiency and in an\nincrease of air emissions.\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nThis correlation is illustrated by the following example for a power plant, in which an\nalternative, presumably less effective, cooling system leads to a loss in efficiency of the power\nplant of about 3% (Table 1.2). As a result the resource input of the power plant and its emissions\nto air will also increase with about 3%. As the emissions also depend on the fuel used, they\ncould easily be different in another situation, but no data were available to evaluate this point\nfurther.\nTable 1.2: Emissions of an average Western European power plant due to an efficiency loss of 3%\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nEmissions to air\nEmissions / energy\ninput in [g/kWh]\nAdditional emission due to a loss\nof 3% efficiency [g/kWh]\nCO2\n\n 14.6\nSO2\n2.4\n0.072\nNOx\n1.0\n0.031\nDust\n0.2\n0.006\nPrimary energy input: 2.65 kW and additional energy input 0.08 kW\nHow the selection of a cooling system can affect the performance is well illustrated by the\nfollowing examples taken from Caudron [tm056, Caudron, 1991]. These figures highlight the\neffects of the selection of a cooling system under the given climate conditions. So care must be\ntaken, as the loss of efficiency that can occur depends on the choice of the cooling system, the\nclimatic conditions and the design of the turbine. Condenser vacuums (condenser pressures) will\nvary accordingly as illustrated in the following tables. In areas where higher ambient\ntemperatures occur, the vacuum levels are higher with dry systems and can reach up to 425\nmbar. But many other factors, such as fouling, scaling, corrosion and sub-optimal design, may\nlead to similar losses of efficiency.\nTable 1.3: Relative effect on the delivery of electrical power due to the application of wet, wet/dry\nor dry cooling towers to units of 1300 MWe.\n[tm056, Caudron, 1991]\nWet cooling tower\nWet/dry\ncooling\ntower\nDry cooling tower\nType of\nrefrigeration\nsystem\nOnce-\nthrough\nWet\nnatural\ndraught\nNatural\ndraught\nInduced\ndraught\nInduced\ndraught\nNatural\ndraught\nInduced\ndraught\nApproach K (dry air\n11[°C] / wet air\n9[°C])\n-\n\n12.5\n12.5\n13.5\n\n\nNominal\ncondensation\npressure (mbar)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThermal power\n(MWth)\n\n\n\n-\n-\n-\n-\nElectrical power\nDelivered (MWe)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifference of\nelectrical power\ndelivered (%)\n+ 1.9\n\n\n- 0.8\n- 0.8\n- 2\n- 3.5\nIn the table the once-through system is taken as starting point to benchmark the other systems.\nThe approaches of the recirculating cooling systems are additional to the approach of the heat\nexchanger (condenser) which is assumed to be equal for all systems.\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nFrom this table it is clear that the choice of cooling system, such as for a dry instead of a wet\nsystem, needs careful consideration. The table also shows why many power plants are located\npreferably on the coast or on large rivers. From the production point of view, once-through\nsystems are more efficient than the reference system (wet natural draught).\nFor combined cycles, the condenser pressure and electrical power delivered vary similarly with\nthe type of the cooling system and the relative loss of power becomes even more clear.\nTable 1.4: Relative effect on the delivery of electrical power due to the application of wet, wet/dry\nor dry cooling towers to a 290 MWth combined cycle unit\n[EDF, pers. comm., 1999]\nWet cooling tower\nType of cooling system\nOnce-through\nNatural\ndraught\nInduced\ndraught\nAir-cooled\ncondenser\nApproach K (dry air\n11[°C]/wet air 9[°C])\n/\n≈8\n≈8\n≈29\nNominal condensation\npressure (mbar)\n\n\n\n\nThermal power (MWth)\n\n\n\n\nDifference of electrical\npower delivered\n(MWe)\n+ 0.65\n\n-1.05\n-5.65\n1.2.2 Non-sensitive applications\nOther applications are less sensitive to temperature. The efficiency of these processes is less\ncorrelated with temperature or pressure. For these processes the focus should be on the\neconomically and ecologically most efficient cooling system to dissipate waste heat that remains\nafter all the possible options for reuse have been exploited.\n1.3 Optimising the primary process and reuse of heat\nOptimisation of the overall energy efficiency of the primary process will not be dealt with in\ndepth in this reference document. However, in the preventive “approach” of IPPC this\noptimisation should be done first before removal of waste heat is contemplated. In other words,\nthe need for heat discharge has to be minimised, which will simultaneously affect the\nconfiguration and size of the required cooling system. Furthermore, the cooling system does not\nnecessary mean discharge into the environment, as successful attempts have been made to use\nthis energy as well.\n1.3.1 Optimising the primary process\nThe optimisation of the primary process can significantly reduce the overall environmental\neffects. In many Member States the majority of the non-recoverable heat to be disposed of by\ncooling systems is due to power generation. Depending on the overall efficiency, up to 60 % of\nthe fuel energy is transferred into waste heat. If the efficiency of the power generating process is\nincreased, environmental effects can be reduced and the cooling system plays a crucial role\nhere. For other industrial sectors this principle can be applied as well, at the same time lowering\nthe energy costs, the amount of heat discharged to the environment, as well as the emissions to\nair (CO2). Generally, the higher the heat level the more easily it can be recovered.\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nA few examples of currently applied techniques are:\n• \npreheating fuel or raw materials (metals);\n• \npinch-technology;\n• \nexternal applications (e.g. heating greenhouses/ residential areas);\n• \nco-generation in power industry.\nInstead of using cooling water or air only, it is customary at refineries to preheat fuels by using\na cold incoming hydrocarbon stream to cool down a hot refined stream leaving the unit.\nConsequently, there is a reduced need to preheat the (cold) crude fuel and a lower demand for\ncooling water. Depending on the process the number of cold streams can be limited and a\ncertain need for cooling water or air will remain.\nCo-generation, or combined heat and power generation, is used in the power industry and in\nother industrial sectors (e.g. paper industry, (petro-) chemical industry). Where both forms of\nenergy are needed, their generation can be combined. This saves energy, reduces CO2 and SO2\nemissions and requires hardly any cooling, thereby avoiding the need for (large) cooling\nsystems.\n1.3.2 Use of waste heat off-site\nIf optimising the waste heat generating process does not lead to any further waste heat\nreduction, the BAT “approach” would be to assess, whether any option of reuse of waste heat\ncan be found. This issue is beyond the scope of IPPC as it also relates to generic good\nenvironmental energy management. It can be done on an existing site as well as an integral part\nof site selection (see next chapter). Finding adequate consumers is, however, not a trivial task.\nOften requirements of consumers are not reconcilable with the cooling demands. In some cases,\nheat consumers require a higher temperature level than planned. If it is technically possible to\noperate the primary process on a higher temperature level, the overall energy balance has to be\ncarefully observed. Often the loss of energy efficiency in the primary process outweighs the\nsavings through the “waste“ energy consumption. Also, care should be taken in creating a\nsituation, in which there develops a dependency on the availability of “waste” heat.\nA number of examples can be found of the external application of “waste” heat of power\nstations for district heating of homes and offices during winter periods or heating of\ngreenhouses by applying co-generation or operating a combined cycle. The applications can\nraise fuel utilisation efficiency from around 40% up to more than 70% and thus decrease the\ncooling demand of the installation. In the examples reported, a hybrid cooling tower with\nvariable fan speed is used to be able to adapt to the varying need for district heating. In another\ncase the tower only needed to be operated in dry mode at about 10% of its total capacity as soon\nas outdoor air temperature had dropped to 5ºC, simply because maximum external use of heat\nwas reached at that point. This raises the question of the extent to which the potential options for\nreuse can influence the choice of a cooling system where flexibility of operation is required.\nCurrently no examples are known that show how the options for reuse are reflected in the\nselection of a cooling system.\n1.4 Selecting of a cooling system in order to meet the process\nrequirements and site conditions\n1.4.1 Process requirements\nOnce the level of heat (high, medium, and low) has been assessed, a first rough selection could\nbe done by applying Table 1.1. In addition to the heat level, many more factors are also\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\ninvolved in the selection of a cooling system in order to meet the process requirements and\ngeneral site conditions, such as:\n• \nthe required minimum end temperature of the substance to be cooled,;\n• \nthe required cooling capacity;\n• \nthe requirement for an indirect circuit, which increases the approach;\n• \nclimatic conditions, water availability and space requirements.\nIn view of the indirect effects of sub-optimal process cooling, the required minimum end\ntemperature of the process to be cooled is crucial. This means that the cooling system(s) used or\nto be chosen will have to achieve this end temperature and at the same time meet other (process-\nrelated) requirements. Cooling system performance should preferably be optimised, taking into\naccount the annual temperature range of the coolant. For wet cooling, the wet bulb temperature\nis important and there is some flexibility to select a design temperature, which in its turn will\naffect the size of the cooling system and its power requirements. Reduction of the size of\ncooling systems has to be carefully evaluated and accepted only case by case. Some plants have\nto be operated the whole year round with acceptable efficiencies and maximum rated output.\nFor example, when mechanical draught towers or dry air coolers are used, it is possible to\noperate the system in the most economical way if coolers have several cells. Some of them can\nbe taken out of operation in order to save water and electric energy without an appreciable loss\nof efficiency.\nFigure 1.2: Tower plan area as a function of the percentage of time the design wet bulb\ntemperature is exceeded\n(design temperatures 40/24/18ºC), [tm083, Adams and Stevens]\nWith respect to the power industry, Figure 1.2 is not applicable as optimisation of the cold end\nis done using validated temperatures:\n• \nfor wet or dry cooling towers the wet (or dry) air temperature is taken for all year around,\nusing one value for every 3 hours;\n• \nfor once-through the water temperature is measured and one value per month is\nrecommended.\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nThen, optimisation is done taking into account the valorisation of energy for the whole year.\nThis method, called global actualised balance, is explained in Annex XII.\nGenerally, in most industries a safety margin is applied to ensure that the cooling system will\nmeet the cooling demand at any time and especially in the summer months. In circumstances\nwhere the wet bulb temperature at all times remains well below the design wet bulb temperature\nor where the heat load appears to be lower, the heat exchanger may has overcapacity. If this is\nexpected, consideration could be given to operational measures, such as variable fan operation,\nthat allow the system to run below capacity and thereby reduce the direct energy demand.\nIn many industries, it is practice to oversize the cooling system at the installation stage to leave\nroom for capacity growth: the spare capacity is then gradually used up until a new tower needs\nto be added. When a licence application for expanding production and cooling capacity is being\nconsidered, an assessment must always be made of the extent to which there is spare capacity in\nthe existing cooling system, whether inefficiently used (because it is underused) or not well\nmaintained.\nThis strategy makes it possible to determine the required cooling capacity (kWth or MWth), the\nsize of the cooling system (heat exchanger) and perhaps even the choice of coolant (water or\nair). In Europe the industries that require large cooling capacities for low process temperatures\n(power stations and (petro-) chemical industry) have a preference for sites, where large and\nreliable source of water is available and where the use of once-through systems is possible.\nWhere the water supply is limited large capacity open wet or wet/dry cooling towers are used.\nThe need to cool (potentially) harmful substances can also affect the size of the cooling system\nas well as the possible end temperature (See e.g. VCI-safety concept in Chapter 3 and Annex\nVI). In this situation the BAT ”approach” can lead to the conclusion that the effects of leakage\ncan only be adequately prevented if a secondary (indirect) system is applied. This means that a\nsecond circulation has to be designed and the design temperature will increase, following an\nincrease of the approach. This will lead to higher end temperatures of the substance to be cooled\nand further reduction in the overall efficiency.\n1.4.2 Site selection\nIt is obvious that there is a limit to the extent in which site-specific characteristics can be\noptimised by choosing the optimal site. For existing systems the site simply is a given value and\nenvironmental optimisation will have to be considered within the restrictions of the site. For\ninstance, restricting water use by changing to dry air-cooling might seem to be an obvious\nchoice. However, climate conditions may not allow this where dry bulb temperature is expected\nto exceed the required design temperature for a large part of the year unless a reduced output of\nthe production process is accepted as well as a simultaneous reduction in the overall efficiency\nof the plant.\nIf site selection is an option, the requirements of the cooling process can be influenced\nsignificantly. Therefore it is important that during the design phase all the following aspects are\nconsidered in the site selection process:\n• \nquantity, quality and costs of cooling medium available (water as well as air),\n• \navailable size (area, height, weight of cooling installations),\n• \neffect on the quality of water and on aquatic organisms,\n• \neffect on the quality of air,\n• \nmeteorological effects,\n• \ndischarges of chemical substances into water,\n• \nnoise emissions,\n• \naesthetic aspects of the building,\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n• \ncapital expenditure for cooling systems, pumps, piping and water treatment,\n• \noperating costs for pumps, fans and water treatment,\n• \nannual costs for maintenance and repair,\n• \noperating parameters such as minimum service life, annual operating time, average load in\nthermal output and water flow rate,\n• \noperating requirements such as required approach and systems availability,\n• \nenvironmental legislative requirements regarding heat emissions, plume emissions, acoustic\nemissions, overall height etc.\n• \nfor power plants: plant efficiency losses, capital expenditure to compensate power output\nlosses, plant lifetime and energy revenue losses due to lower plant efficiency.\nSpace\nDifferent cooling systems need different amounts of space for the same cooling performance\nand vary in area requirements, height and weight. It depends on the heat transfer principle they\nfollow (See Annex I).\nFor large systems, space restrictions can be an issue and will be part of the site assessment. The\napplies to processes to be cooled entirely by air where large multi-cell constructions are needed\nto ensure the required cooling capacity. For smaller capacities, space restrictions should not be a\nlimiting factor as roof constructions are on the market that are specifically designed for these\nsituations.\nRestrictions on space at existing sites, for instance in densely built urban areas or densely built\nindustrial sites, are an important factor in the selection of cooling systems. For example, a\ncooling tower on top of a building needs no additional ground space, but the roof location may\nimpose restrictions on its weight.\nSpace and height requirements are important criteria for air-cooled and hybrid systems. The\nventilation of air can be achieved by natural draught or by ventilation with fans (mechanical\ndraught). For the same cooling capacity natural draught cooling systems have to be far bigger\nand higher than mechanical draught systems.\nSite assessment\nRegarding site selection in a number of Member States, it is common practice that for a large\nsite an environmental impact assessment will be required as part of the permitting procedure.\nAlso, due to the potential high impact of site selection on the cooling performance, there have\nbeen initiatives to pre-select optimum cooling sites in regional planning programmes.\nAn example of the assessment of a site for cooling systems with a large water requirement such\nas those used by power plants, is given in Table 1.5 [tm012, UBA, 1982]. A combination of\nlocal criteria leads towards the classification of a site with its suitability being most,\nintermediate or least favourable. It should be remarked that using such an assessment is again\nonly part of the total assessment and that a grade 3 site (doubtful suitability) could well be\nfavourable on the overall balance of factors.\nAn example of the consequences of site selection can be seen when the BAT “approach” is used\nfor a site qualified as grade 3.\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable 1.5: Large cooling demand-related criteria for site selection\n(Derived from [tm012, UBA, 1982])\nCriteria\nGrade 1\n(good suitability)\nGrade 2\n(satisfactory suitability)\nGrade 3\n(doubtful suitability)\nExplanations\nSufficient \ncooling \nwater\nsupply\n W\nNNQ > -----------------\n ζ c ∆T\nPlentiful cooling water supply\n W\nNNQ ≈ -----------------\n ζ c ∆T\nSufficient cooling water supply\n W\nNNQ < -----------------\n ζ c ∆T\nInsufficient cooling water supply\nwithout technical measures\nNNQ: lowest known volume flow of\nsurface water\nW: heat stream to be transferred into\nwater\nζ: density of the water\nc: specific heat capacity of water\n∆T: permitted temperature increase\n of surface water\nSuitable water quality\nWater quality class\nII moderately polluted\nII/III critically polluted\nWater quality class\nIII severely contaminated\nIrrespective of quality class\n(German water quality classification)\nI non-polluted\nII moderately polluted\nII/III critically polluted\nIII-IV very severely contaminated\nIV excessively contaminated\nComplying with permitted\nevaporation losses\nV < A a\nMinor evaporation losses\nV ≈ A a\nBearable evaporation losses\nV > A a\nEvaporation losses not acceptable\nwithout technical measures\nV: evaporation losses at selected site\n(volume flow)\nA: permitted evaporation for the site\na: fraction of A which may be used\nlimited by other waste heat sources of\nthe site\nImpact on drinking water\nsupply\nCooling water discharge has no\nimpact on drinking water supply\nCooling water discharge may\nunder \ncertain \ncircumstances\nimpact drinking water supply,\nnegative effects can be avoided\nCooling water discharge impacts\ndrinking water supply, negative\neffects cannot be ruled out without\nadditional technical measures\nThis criterion has to be considered if,\ndownstream of the site, drinking water is\nobtained from the surface water (currently\nor planned in future)\nFrequency of long plumes\nwith low altitude and waste\nheat transfer in direct site\nvicinity (radius 2 km)\nVery low frequency (<2% p.a. on\naverage) long (<100 m) plumes with\nlow altitude (≤300m) and waste heat\ntransfer < 10 000 MW\nLong plumes with low altitude\nmore frequent and waste heat\ntransfer\n< 10 000 MW\nWaste heat transfer\n > 10 000 MW\nTopographic situation in the\nvicinity of the site\nNo or only few elevations with an\naltitude higher than the cooling\ntower within about 20 km radius of\nthe site\nSeveral elevations higher than\nabove the cooling tower within\nabout 2 -20 km radius of the site\nSeveral elevations higher than the\ncooling tower within less than 2 km\nradius of the site\nPossibility of economic use\nof waste heat\nGreat potential for economically\nfeasible usage of district heating\nLittle potential for economically\nfeasible usage of district heating\nNo possibility of economic waste\nheat usage or doubtfull because not\nthoroughly investigated\nThe possibility for economic usage of\nwaste heat increases attractiveness of a\nsite and may overcome other\ndisadvantages and lower the heat\ndischarge\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe assessment should start with a selection of options for reuse of heat, as this could have an effect on the\ncooling water demand. This criterion cannot be met as no external heat use is possible and all non-\nrecoverable heat will have to be discharged. Water supply and permitted evaporation are limited and in\nrespect of plumes there may be disturbance in the vicinity of the site. If for process reasons a water-cooled\nsystem is necessary, water saving methods will have to be applied and, for example, a recirculating system\n(e.g. open wet cooling tower) instead of a once-through system would be recommended. This will imply the\napplication of some kind of water treatment, depending on water quality and cycles of concentration. The\nadditional requirement would be plume suppression, which prompts consideration of a hybrid configuration.\nIf enough space is available and climatic conditions favourable, the use of air-cooling may equally be\nconsidered. The integrated “approach” would follow with a comparison of energy use and costs.\nThe site selection process requires that for the “final candidate” site, detailed considerations about the\nselection of the possible cooling systems be conducted in order to find the overall optimum solution.\n1.4.3 Climatic conditions\nThe climate expressed in terms of wet and dry bulb temperatures is an extremely important site-specific\ncondition. It influences both the choices of the type of cooling and the possible end temperature of the\nprocess to be cooled. The contradiction of cooling with air and/or water is that when the cooling demand is\nhigh it becomes more difficult to achieve the requirements. Particularly in areas where high air temperatures\nand high water temperatures coincide with lower water availability during part of the year a certain\noperational flexibility of the cooling system can be very important and may be achieved by combining water\nand air cooling. Sometimes, however, a certain loss of efficiency may have to be accepted.\nTo reach the required process temperature it is an obvious requirement of all cooling systems that the cooling\nmedium must have a lower temperature than the medium to be cooled, but this depends on the dry and wet\nbulb temperatures. For both water and air-cooled systems, seasonal variations in the temperature of the\ncooling medium can be limit the choice of cooling system and can demand a certain way of operation.\nWet bulb temperature is always lower than dry bulb temperature (Table 1.6). The wet bulb temperature\ndepends on the measured temperature of the atmosphere, the humidity and the air pressure. For latent\n(evaporative) heat transfer the wet bulb temperature is the relevant temperature. It is theoretically the lowest\ntemperature to which water can be cooled by evaporation. For sensible heat transfer the dry bulb (dry air)\ntemperature is relevant, where air is the coolant.\nFor the selection of the type and design of cooling system, the design temperature is important and usually\nrelates to the summer levels of the wet bulb and dry bulb temperatures. The bigger the difference between\nthese temperatures and the higher the dry bulb temperatures, the more difficult it will be to reach low end\ntemperatures with dry air-cooled systems. As mentioned earlier, this can lead to efficiency losses. Measures\ncan be taken to overcome the loss, but they require a certain investment. For economic reasons it is useful to\ndetermine the variation of these temperatures throughout the year and what percentage of the year the\nmaximum temperatures are actually reached.\nAs an example, Table 1.6 shows how for different climate conditions in Europe the choice for a dry or a wet\ncooling system can affect process efficiency losses due to the Carnot cycle. In the example, the approach for\nwet cooling is considered to be 4 K and this has to be added to the wet bulb temperature to get the minimum\nend temperature of the coolant. The approach for dry cooling is set at 12 K to be added to the dry bulb\ntemperature. The larger the difference between the wet and the dry end temperatures, the higher the loss of\nefficiency (in this example), where losses of 0.35% per K on average occur. At the same time, with for\nexample 5% efficiency loss, the efficiency of a conventional power plant would be 38.6% instead of 40%\n(See Annex XII.6).\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable 1.6: Climatic conditions in Europe\n(derived from [tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nCountry and station\nDry-bulb\ntemp.

It is\nparticularly important to study:\n•\nwater withdrawals and discharges,\n•\nthe visual aspects of the site,\n•\nthe development of plumes,\n•\nthe thermal and chemical impacts on the receiving environment.\nThe objective of the pilot loop tests is to define the optimum treatment of cooling water both\nwith regard to scaling and to any biological developments. To do so, pilot facilities representing\nreal commercial operating conditions are installed on the site for about one year. This makes it\npossible to take account of variations in the quality of the waterway in the course of the seasons\nand to try out some options on a representative scale (e.g. choice of cooling tower fills, choice\nof alloy).\n1.5 Selecting \na \ncooling \ntechnique \nin \norder \nto \nmeet\nenvironmental requirements\nThe environmental requirements can affect cooling systems application and are an additional\nstep in the balanced selection of a new cooling system or in the optimisation of an existing\ncooling system. Generally, five major aspects with consequences for cooling systems selection\ncan be distinguished:\n• \nminimisation of energy use\n• \nminimisation of heat emissions\n• \nminimisation of large plume emissions\n• \nminimisation of emissions to water\n• \nminimisation of noise emissions\n• \nminimisation of immissions to soil and terrestrial habitats\nThe aspects are cross-linked and each choice potentially has its consequences for one of the\nother aspects. The aim is to prevent emissions to the environment from routine operations. In\nthis assessment step the differences between water-, air- and air/water-cooling should become\nclear as well as the operational consequences of the choice of a particular design or a particular\nmaterial.\n1.5.1 General comparison between air and water cooled systems\nMinimisation of the environmental aspects is often translated into a comparison between water-\nand air-cooling systems. It has been advocated earlier in the document that a judgement of water\nversus air cooling should not be made in a general sense as this leaves out the local constraints\nthat might limit the use of either system. However, it could be opportune to consider or\nreconsider water requirements of a cooling system in view of programmes on water\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nconservation and of the increasing demand on water with good quality for other purposes (civil\nand industrial) than cooling.\nThe economical turning point in the choice between dry air cooling and water cooling systems\nis not fixed and according to literature will be somewhere between 50°C and 65°C (as end\ntemperature) depending on the local climatic conditions.\nSome general remarks have been made in a comparison of the features of dry air cooling and\nwet cooling systems with the same required cooling capacity: [tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nOn space requirements:\n• \nAir-cooling demands space because of the low specific heat capacity of air. The space can\nbe kept to a minimum by installing air-coolers above other process equipment or a pipe\nbridge;\n• \nAir-cooling systems have limits to their location as they cannot be placed too close to\nbuildings because of the resulting air-circulation, blockage of air-supply and the danger of\nrecirculation;\nMaintenance costs\n• \nGenerally maintenance costs for air cooling are considered to be lower as they do not\nrequire anti-scaling and mechanical cleaning of the water-contact surface area and do not\nrequire additional surface area to compensate for surface loss caused by pollution on the\nwater side;\nProcess control\n• \nControl of the temperature of the process is easier with air-cooling or with a recirculating\nflow than with once-through cooling, where the balance of water inlet and outlet restricts\nthe controllability of the water flow and the temperature increase. With mechanical draught\ncooling or evaporative systems there is no limit to the available amount of air, and the\nairflow can be adjusted according to the process demand using fan cycling, a multi-fan\ninstallation or modulating capacity control;\n• \nControl of leakage in cooling-water is easier to detect, although detection of leakage in\ncondensers is reported to be more difficult. Usually this affects the efficiency of the process.\n1.5.2 Design factors and choice of materials\nFollowing the BAT “approach”, the design of the cooling system and the choice of materials to\nbe used are an important preventive step. Both can affect the operation as the required amount\nof direct energy consumption, the occurrence of controlled (water treatment) and uncontrolled\n(leakage) emissions to the environment, noise emissions, and the direction of heat emissions\n(water or air). Also, the selected design and materials will require a certain level of investment.\nAgain, the balance is sought between the level of prevention of emissions by design and used\nmaterials and the investment costs involved. This again is a site-specific and complex matter in\nwhich the following factors are taken into account:\n• \ntype of operation (e.g. once-through or recirculating)\n• \ndesign of cooler and layout of cooling system (direct/indirect)\n• \npressure level (condenser)\n• \ncomposition and corrosiveness of the cooling water\n• \ncomposition and corrosiveness of the medium to be cooled\n• \nrequired longevity and costs\nA range of materials is available and, in order of increasing resistance, most commonly used are\ncarbon steel, coated (galvanised) steel, aluminium/brass, copper/nickel, adequate types of\nstainless steel and titanium. Within these groups a further sub-classification on the quality is\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nused. Especially resistance to corrosion, mechanical erosion and biological pollution is greatly\ndetermined by the quality of the water combined with possible conditioning agents.\nIn Annex IV some considerations on the selection of material are given for once-through and\nopen recirculating systems. For each industrial cooling system a similar assessment can be\ndone. In case of water and water/air systems the material that can be selected depends on both\nthe coolant and the process medium, whereas with primary closed circuit dry cooling, the\nprocess medium is more important.\nIt is obvious that for different parts of the installation different materials can be used. The\nquality of material least sensitive to the corrosiveness of the water or to the conditions of the\nprocess is preferred. If more sensitive materials (alloys) are chosen, the consequence can be that\na complex cooling water treatment and control program is needed, which will lead to emissions\nand costs.\nTable 1.7 shows an example on the effect caused by differences in design. Three towers are\ndesigned for the same cooling performance and the same required environmental performance.\nThe choice for a cooling system means different sizes, but in particular a difference in energy\ncosts as about 7 kW more is needed for the closed circuit cooling tower to be able to give the\nsame performance with the same sound power level. In this case costs of operation may lead to\nchoose one of the other options. For other design factors similar comparisons can be made,\nwhich may lead to different effects favouring another option.\nTable 1.7: Comparison of different cooling systems with a required maximum sound power level\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nMechanical draught\nwet cooling tower\nClosed circuit cooling\ntower\nHybrid closed circuit\ncooling tower\nClimate:\ndry bulb temperature\n26 °C\nwet bulb temperature\n18 °C\nGiven Duties:\nCapacity\n1200 kW\ninlet temperature\n38 °C\noutlet temperature\n32 °C\nFlow\n47.8 l/s\nsound power level\n90 dB(A)\n90 dB(A)\n90 dB(A)\nSpecific Data:\nLength\n3.7 m\n3.7 m\n5.2 m\nWidth\n2.8 m\n2.4 m\n2.0 m\nHeight\n3.2 m\n4.2 m\n3.0 m\nFan power\n5 kW\n11 kW\n5.0 kW\nSpray pump power\n1 kW\n2.2 kW\n1.0 kW\n1.5.3 Options for a technological change of existing systems\nFor a new cooling system, there will be more flexibility to select between complete systems and\nto assess the alternative options, whereas for an existing installation a change of technology\noften is a drastic solution. Sometimes in specific cases, it is possible to change the technology,\nbut the number of options to reduce emissions via technological solutions is limited for existing\ninstallations. As the BAT “approach” considers that prevention of emissions prevails, taking\ninto account also the economical aspects, change of technology is an option that should be\nconsidered before the optimisation of operating a cooling system is to be further assessed. In the\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nfollowing paragraphs observations and experiences by suppliers are presented to give examples\nof possible optimisation steps in the BAT “approach” (See also Annex XI).\n1.5.3.1 Retrofit – reasons and considerations\nRetrofitting existing installations can be considered for the following reasons:\n1. replace existing technology by a different technology with lower operating demands,\n2. replace outdated technology equipment by modern equipment with higher efficiency, and\n3. modify existing equipment to improve performance or to meet additional demands.\nDifferent from the selection of a new installation, where the site parameters can be more or less\ndefined, in retrofit scenarios usually the following number of parameters is fixed:\n• \nspace - the retrofit installation must fit into the existing space,\n• \nthe availability of operating resources – the new installation should not exceed the operating\nresources, which were needed for the old one, new infrastructure would result in an increase\nin costs, and\n• \nlegislative restrictions – environmental impacts, like sound criteria, usually have to be at the\nsame level or below the ones of the old installation.\nSpace is often an important reason for retrofitting itself. If a plant or building will be built new\non an existing space-restricted site, it could be a solution to select a new type of cooling system,\nwhich can be placed on the roof of a building or which needs less space than the old one.\nThe preferred solution would be a new installation with lower operation needs, so that the\nretrofit is also associated with lower operating costs. Lower operating cost will be one of the\nmain reasons for retrofitting. It is preferred, however, to consider a retrofit scenario, which\nreduces the emissions as well as the consumption of operating resources. In general this will\nrequire higher investment cost. Considering the operating cost savings and any potential\nreduction in emissions, larger investment costs can pay off in short periods of time.\nAll retrofit scenarios have to consider both the cooling technology and the process to be cooled.\nBoth have to be seen as one system. Changes in the cooling system may have effects on the\nprocess and vice versa. The first aim of any retrofit must be to maintain, or if possible improve,\nthe efficiency of the process to be cooled. On the other hand, changes in the process to be\ncooled will also result in different demands on the cooling system. This could be another\nimportant reason for retrofitting.\nChanges in the process to be cooled can result in a change of demands on the cooling system.\n• Due to new technology less waste heat is generated by the process, less cooling capacity is\nneeded (example: computer terminals, processes with friction).\n• The temperature level of the waste heat has changed, both to higher or lower temperatures\n(example: incineration processes).\n• Larger parts of the generated heat of the process are recuperated, so less waste heat has to\nbe removed to the environment.\n• The temperature sensitivity of the process is increased, a more efficient cooling system is\nneeded.\nTable 1.8 summarises the options for technological upgrading that, according to suppliers\ninformation, can be considered to be technically easy (E), possible (P), difficult (D), not\npossible (NP), or does not apply (NA). Generally, each system has a varying number of options\nfor retrofit. NP-E is an indication that the application of an option is largely dependent on the\nspecific situation, in which the cooling system operates. (See also Chapter 3 and Annexes).\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 1.8: Technological upgrading options for existing systems\n(pers. comm.)\nIndustrial cooling systems1\nOption\nOTCS\nOWCT\nOWDCT\nCCWCT\nCCDCT\nCCWDCT\nGeneral\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nE\nImprove capacity\nE\nE\nD\nD\nD\nD\nReduce kWe\nD\nE\nD\nE\nD\nD\nReduce water-use\nNA\nNP-E\nD\nNP-E\nNA\nD\nReduce plume\nNA\nNP-E\nNA\nE\nNA\nNA\nReduce noise\nNA\nE\nD\nE\nD\nE\nReduce drift\nNA\nE\nE\nE\nNA\nE\nNotes:\n1System code (see also Chapter 2):\nOTCS\n – once-through cooling system\nOWCT\n – open wet cooling tower\nOWDCT\n – open wet/dry cooling tower\nCCWCT\n – closed circuit wet cooling tower\nCCDCT\n – closed circuit dry cooling tower\nCCWDCT\n – closed circuit wet dry cooling tower\nThere are many possible ways to retrofit a cooling process and some typical scenarios along\nwith their relevant considerations are listed in the following paragraphs.\n1.5.3.2 Change of heat transfer technology\nUsually, lower operational costs associated with a new technology or legislative restrictions are\nmajor reasons for the replacement of one heat transfer technology by another technology.\nA typical example is the replacement of a once-through system by a recirculating system,\nsaving on operating costs (water and sewage) and following restrictions on heat emissions to a\nsurface water. The economic performance of the recirculating system depends on the specific\ncosts for water, sewage and electrical energy. Assuming average water and sewage costs of 1\n[€/m³] and electrical energy costs of 0.1 [€/kWh], the operating costs in this example are\n38800 € for the once-through system and 48000 € (2100 € for water and 27000 € for energy) for\nthe recirculating system. The annual saving is 34000 €, which is higher than the investment\ncosts of 21000 €. If the balance favours the environment in the first place and investment costs\nwill be much larger than annual costs, the investment recovery period will become an important\nfactor.\nIn this example both the environment with respect to water requirements and the company\nbenefit from a change in technology at the same time. The environmental costs however are due\nto additional energy requirements for extra fan and pump energy. Water use in this example is\nby large affected by the evaporation loss which has been calculated by assuming that they\namount to 1.8% of the circulation per 10K of cooling (see Annex V.3).\nThis example merely shows how to approach changes in technology. With different price levels\nthe outcome will be quite different and may favour the once-through system. For example, in\nItaly, where electricity cost is about 0.05 [€/kWh] and water cost for an open circuit 0.01 [€/m3]\nagainst 0.1-0.2 [€/m3] for a closed circuit, the once-through systems would be more favourable\nfrom an economic point of view.\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable 1.9: Example for conversion of a once-through system into a recirculating system\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nExample:\nair compressor 500 kW\nOnce-through system\nRecirculating system\ninlet temperature\n15 °C\n27 °C\noutlet temperature\n35 °C\n35 °C\nflow rate\n6 l/s\n15 l/s\nannual operating hours\n1800 h\n1800 h\nevaporation loss\n-\n1400 m³/a\nblow down\n-\n700 m³/a\nannual water use\n38800 m³/a\n2100 m³/a\nextra fan and pump energy\n-\n15kW\ninvestment cost\n-\n€ 21000\nIf a change of the cooling configuration is considered, the effects on the overall efficiency must\nbe taken into account. If possible, the efficiency should be increased. For temperature sensitive\nprocesses, it needs checking whether a cooling technology can provide lower end temperatures\nat the same level of safety.\nThe example of replacing a water-cooled condenser with an open cooling tower by an\nevaporative condenser shows an effect on end temperature and system efficiency. Such a\ntechnological replacement can potentially reduce the condensing temperature by 4 – 6 K\ndepending on actual conditions. The efficiency gain of such retrofit can be estimated in order of\nmagnitude of 12 – 15 % of the power requirement of the refrigerant compressor [tm139,\nEurovent, 1998]\nFor temperature sensitive applications in the medium temperature range, the introduction of\nhybrid systems could be favourable, where water use and/or water and sewage costs have to be\nreduced. Such a change, generally, does not increase electrical demand, but can reduce the\nannual water consumption considerably. Depending on actual conditions and required size,\nhybrid concepts may require additional space.\n1.5.3.3 Replacement of outdated heat transfer technology by modern one\nOften a change of cooling technology for different reasons is not suitable. However, also a\nmodification of the existing technology could lead to better efficiency, better performance, less\nemissions and lower operating costs. Development of air moving systems and heat transfer\nsurfaces, as well as the application of more durable construction materials, are main reasons for\nreplacement scenarios.\nAs there is usually no change in process temperatures (same technology) the main focus in this\nscenario is to reduce operating resources and environmental impacts as well as to achieve an\nextension of equipment’s life. Equipment’s life extension of more than 10 years can be realised\nby the use of new durable materials. It is very likely that any equipment installed 15 or 20 years\nago, can now be replaced by modern equipment with higher operating efficiency and better\nenvironmental and economic performance.\nA typical example for improvement of once-through cooling systems is the application of the\nmore efficient plate and frame heat exchangers. For evaporative cooling systems for example,\nmajor developments have taken place to improve the performance of fill packs and of air\nmoving systems, resulting in a more compact design with higher energy efficiencies. For air-\ncooled systems, new technology to shape fins in various ways has achieved similar results. An\nexample of what could be the effect on energy use if applying better efficiency is illustrated in\n\nChapter 1\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 1.10. In this case the investment costs need to be balanced with the yearly operation costs\nfor energy use and maintenance of fill.\nTable 1.10: Example for conversion of an outdated mechanical draught wet cooling tower into\nmodern design\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nExample:\nMechanical draught wet\ncooling tower\nOutdated design:\ninduced draught concept\nwith low-efficiency fill and\nfan system\nModern design:\ninduced draught concept\nwith high-efficiency fill and\nfan system\nCapacity\n1200 kW\nInlet temperature\n38 °C\nOutlet temperature\n28 °C\nWet bulb temperature\n21 °C\nWater flow\n28.7 l/s\nFan power requirement\n7.5 kW\n4 kW\nEnergy consumption for fans\n9 MWh/yr\n4.8 MWh/yr\nInvestment cost\n-\n€ 14000\n1.5.3.4 Upgrading existing heat transfer technology\nOften it is not necessary to replace the whole cooling system. The performance of existing\ncooling systems can also be improved by upgrading. Major components or accessories of the\nsystem are replaced or repaired, while the existing installation remains in situ. Upgrading can\nincrease system efficiency and reduce the environmental impact. Examples of upgrading are\nnew and more efficient fill packs of cooling towers and the application of sound-attenuation.\nThe cases in Table 1.11 and Table 1.12 should be considered as simplified illustrations. For an\nintegrated assessment of the environmental gain other factors should be considered as well. For\nexample, with the replacement of cooling tower fill, the environmental costs for the old fill that\nhas to be disposed of must be included also.\nTable 1.11: Example for replacement of outdated fill of a mechanical draught wet cooling tower\nwith modern high efficiency fill\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nExample: mechanical draught wet\ncooling tower\nOutdated fill\nHigh efficient fill\nCapacity\n3600 kW\nInlet temperature\n38 °C\nOutlet temperature\n28 °C\nWet bulb temperature\n21 °C\nWater flow\n86.1 l/s\nExisting cell floor space\n26 m²\nFan power requirement\n22.5 kW\n13.5 kW\nEnergy consumption for fans\n81 MWh/yr\n48.6 MWh/yr\nInvestment cost\n-\n€ 29000\nThat not all changes have only positive effects can be observed from Table 1.12 where a\nconsiderable reduction of the noise level has been achieved. However, noise abatement usually\nleads to fall of pressure, which must be compensated by a higher performance of the fans. This\nin its turn raises the direct energy use of the cooling system. It will be a matter of local\n\nChapter 1\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\npreference whether a lower energy use or a lower noise level prevails. Investment and\nmaintenance costs should be compared with reduced costs for energy consumption.\nUpgrading the operational strategy is another example of efficiency improvement. The on and\nof cycling of fans can be changed into modulating control with frequency converters. This can\nresult in significant savings of electrical energy, which, depending on conditions, can be 70%\nand more.\nInvestment costs for upgrading can differ greatly and depend on the type of upgrading and the\nage of the existing installation. The investment is accompanied by lower operating costs as a\nresult of a higher efficiency. Investment costs for upgrading will generally be lower than those\nfor technology changes or replacements of equipment.\nTable 1.12: Example for the improvement of acoustic performance by addition of sound\nattenuation\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nExample: mechanical draught wet\ncooling tower\nExisting wet cooling tower\nUpgrading with sound\nattenuation\nCapacity\n1200 kW\nInlet temperature\n38 °C\nOutlet temperature\n28 °C\nWet bulb temperature\n21 °C\nWater flow\n28.7 l/s\nFan power requirement\n15 kW\n18kW\nSound power level\n90 dB(A)\n81 dB(A)\nInvestment cost\n-\n€ 12000\n1.6 Economic considerations\nCosts are always among the most important factors for the selection of a cooling system and can\nonly be assessed on an individual project level. Three important types of costs can be\ndistinguished:\n• \ninvestment costs,\n• \nmaintenance costs,\n• \noperating costs related to energy (and water) requirements,\n• \nenvironmental costs, such as taxes and costs for waste disposal.\nThe absolute costs and the relation between the different costs vary and depending on the\ncooling system. The cooling system with lowest investment costs is not necessarily also the\nsystem that requires minimal operating resources. Technical solutions to minimise resource\nconsumption often lead to higher investment cost.\nTherefore, it is important that economic considerations not only focus on simple investment cost\ncomparisons, but also on operating costs of a cooling system. For power plants, operating costs\nare linked to the overall energy efficiency. The financial effect of a variation in efficiency\ncaused by the choice of a different cooling system must be assessed. Generally for power plants,\nthe comparison of different solutions is done using the earlier mentioned techno-economic\nmethod using an ‘actualised’ or ‘valoridated’ ratio that varies between countries. [tm056,\nCaudron, 1991].\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n2 TECHNOLOGICAL \nASPECTS \nOF \nAPPLIED \nCOOLING\nSYSTEMS\n2.1 Introduction\nThis chapter gives brief description of the principles of some of the cooling systems\nconfigurations used in European industry. Within these configurations a variety of applications\ncan be found all aimed at meeting process, site, environmental and economic requirements. The\nsize and type of heat exchanger, type of fans and operational practice also vary. The different\ntypes of cooling systems can be classified by different criteria. The standard literature uses the\nfollowing criteria:\n• \ndry air-cooled and evaporative wet cooled - according to the dominating\nthermodynamic principle – respectively sensible heat transfer and a combination of\nlatent and sensible heat transfer. In evaporative cooling the two principles are coupled,\nbut the main part of heat is transferred latent, at dry cooling only sensible heat transfer\ntakes place.\n• \nopen or closed systems – in an open system the process medium or the coolant is in\ncontact with the environment; in a closed system the process medium or the coolant\ncirculates inside the tubes, coils or conduits and does not have contact with the\nenvironment.\n• \ndirect or indirect systems – in a direct system there is one heat exchanger where coolant\nand medium to be cooled exchange heat; in an indirect system there are at least two heat\nexchangers and a closed secondary cooling circle, between the process or product to be\ncooled and the primary coolant. Due to the additional heat exchanger, indirect systems\nhave a higher approach (about 5 K). Direct and indirect systems are also known as\nprimary and secondary systems. In principle every direct cooling system can be\ntransformed into an indirect system and this option is considered in situations where\nleakage of the process medium would endanger the environment.\nDirect contact cooling systems (not to be confused with direct/indirect) are not described in this\nBREF, because their characteristics depend strongly on the industrial process they are applied to\n(e.g. hot steel). Another type of cooling is a once-through system with barometric condensers, in\nwhich a gas flow is cooled directly by dosage water over it. They can be found in the food\nindustry. These systems are not covered in this document, either are systems that use vacuum\ntechniques or specific refrigerants, such as HCFC.\nIn practice a variety of names used for both cooling equipment and cooling configurations found\ninside and outside of Europe. Nomenclature is often linked to the purpose of the application and\nin power generation plant typology refers to the condensing process (see Annex XII). In general,\nthe following list of systems commonly applied by European industry can be derived from the\nabove-given principles.\n• \nonce-through cooling systems (with or without cooling tower)\n• \nopen recirculating cooling systems (wet cooling towers)\n• \nclosed circuit cooling systems\n- \nair-cooled cooling systems\n- \nclosed circuit wet cooling systems\n• \ncombined wet/dry (hybrid) cooling systems\n- \nopen hybrid cooling towers\n- \nclosed circuit hybrid towers\nFor closed recirculating cooling systems, further distinction can be made between small off-the-\npeg applications and large, tailor-made ones that are constructed or assembled on site.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nGenerally, once-through systems and open recirculating systems are applied to larger plants in\nthe power and the (petro-) chemical industries.\nThe term tower is applied to both shell type constructions (e.g. large natural draught) and cell\ntype constructions, which can be small and can be found in roof type applications.\nFor comparison, some technical and thermodynamic characteristics of the most common\nindustrial cooling systems are summarised in Table 2.1. These data are an example derived from\na given number of assumptions (see legend to the table). It is important to realise that\napproaches can vary and depend largely on the design of the heat exchanger and the temperature\nof the ambient air. The minimum end temperatures of the process medium will vary\naccordingly. For power stations, the approach is calculated in a different way (see Annex I).\nTable 2.1: Example of technical and thermodynamic characteristics of the different cooling systems\nfor industrial (non-power plant) applications\n[tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nCooling system\nCooling\nmedi\num\nMain cooling\nprinciple\nMinimum\napproaches\n(K)4)\nMinimum achievable\nend temperature of\nthe process medium5)\n(°C)\nCapacity of\nindustrial process\n(MWth)\nOpen once-through\nsystem\n- direct\nWater\nConduction/\nConvection\n3 – 5\n18 – 20\n<0.01 - > 2000\nOpen once-through\nsystem\n- indirect\nWater\nConduction/\nConvection\n6 – 10\n21 – 25\n<0.01 - > 1000\nOpen recirculating\ncooling system\n-\ndirect\nWater1)\nAir2)\nEvaporation3)\n6 – 10\n27 – 31\n< 0.1 – >2000\nOpen recirculating\ncooling system\n-\nindirect\nWater1)\nAir2)\nEvaporation3)\n9 – 15\n30 – 36\n< 0.1 - > 200\nClosed circuit wet\ncooling system\nWater1)\nAir2)\nEvaporation\n+ convection\n7 – 147)\n28 – 35\n0.2 – 10\nClosed circuit dry air\ncooling system\nAir\nConvection\n10 – 15\n40 – 45\n< 0.1 – 100\nOpen hybrid cooling\nWater1)\nAir2)\nEvaporation\n+ convection\n7 – 14\n28 – 35\n0.15 - 2.5 6)\nClosed hybrid\ncooling\nWater1)\nAir2)\nEvaporation\n+ convection\n7 – 14\n28 – 35\n0.15 - 2.5 6)\nNotes:\n1) \nWater is the secondary cooling medium and is mostly recirculated.

For reasons of\nspace and costs, dry air-cooling systems are generally not used for very large capacities,\nwhereas water cooling can be applied for the discharge of heat up to 2000 MWth or more.\nFor condensers the approaches are higher. The approach for once through systems corresponds\nto the sum of the “terminal difference” and the temperature rise of the cooling water. The term\n“terminal difference” to the temperature difference between the temperature of the steam\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nentering the condenser (or the condensed steam leaving the condenser) and the temperature of\nthe cooling medium (water) leaving the condenser. The values differ between 3 and 5 K. The\napplicable data are presented in Table 2.2.\nTable 2.2: Examples of capacity and thermodynamic characteristics of different cooling systems for\napplications in power industry\n[Comment EDF/[tm056, Caudron, 1991][tm056, Caudron, 1991][tm056, Caudron, 1991]]\nCooling system\nApplied approaches (K)\nCapacity of power generating\nprocess (MWth)\nOpen once-through systems\n13-20 (terminal difference 3-5)\n< 2700\nOpen wet cooling tower\n7-15\n< 2700\nOpen hybrid cooling tower\n15-20\n< 2500\nDry air cooled condenser\n15-25\n< 900\nThis chapter gives an overview of the most common industrial cooling systems and an\nindication of their associated environmental aspects. More detailed information on heat\nexchangers and material can be found in Annexes III and V, as well as in the documents in the\nreference list. In the following paragraphs the technical terms will be used that have been most\ncommonly encountered in the literature. As an aid to consulting references, an indication will be\ngiven where other terms are also used.\n2.2 Heat exchangers\nHeat exchangers are the crucial heat transferring elements, being part of both the process to be\ncooled and the cooling system. After the heat exchanger, different systems are used to discharge\nthe heat into the environment. Two types of heat exchangers are commonly in use: the shell and\ntube type (the most common) and the plate and frame type.\n2.2.1 Shell and tube heat exchangers\nThere is a lot of experience with this kind of heat exchanger in the process industry and it has\nproven reasonably reliable. There is a range of different designs, where tubes run straight or in a\nU-form or where the heat exchanger is particularly designed for high-pressure conditions, high\ntemperatures, operating with steam or thermal fluids. Usually the tubes contain the cooling\nwater and the process medium moves around the tubes within the shell. For a more extensive\ndiscussion on shell and tube heat exchangers see Annex II.\n2.2.2 Plate and frame heat exchangers\nPlate and frame heat exchangers are increasingly used for a range of applications in sugar\nrefineries, (petro-) chemical industry and power plants. They are particularly suitable for use at\na lower approach as well as in cold applications (< 0ºC). However, these exchangers are less\nsuitable for cooling of steam and high gas volumes, and in situations where there is danger of\nsedimentation and/or fouling and for high pressure differences between the process fluid and the\ncoolant. Some designs have a double construction to guarantee leakage-free operation, but this\nis reported to be very difficult to maintain. Plate and frame heat exchangers are economic as\nthey can be much more compact (e.g. circular) than shell and tubes with the equivalent\nexchange surface area.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n2.2.3 Environmental issues of heat exchangers\nFrom an environmental point of view the following issues are important for both types of heat\nexchangers:\n- \nadequate design for efficient heat exchange;\n- \nproper construction to prevent leakage of the process fluid into the cooling medium;\n- \nchoice of material for the efficiency of heat transfer, for resistance to corrosion in water and\nto corrosion due to the process medium;\n- \npossibility of using mechanical cleaning devices.\n2.3 Once-through cooling systems\n2.3.1 Direct once-through cooling systems\nTechnical description\nIn direct once-through systems, water is pumped from a source (e.g. a river, lake, sea or estuary)\nvia large water inlet channels directly to the process. After passing heat exchangers or\ncondensers the heated water is discharged directly back into the surface water. The heat is\ntransferred from the process to the coolant through the partition wall in the form of tubes in a\nshell & tube or in a plate & frame heat exchanger. Once-through systems are identified by\nvarious names. For example, in the paper industry, many mills refer to their once-through\ncooling water as \"mill supply\". [tm010, Betz, 1991]\nFigure 2.1: Schematic representation of a direct once-through cooling system\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nCooling capacity\nOnce-through systems are designed mostly for large cooling capacities (>1000 MWth), but may\nalso be designed for small systems (< 10 kWth). Typical water flows for large power plants to\ncool 1 MWth are in the range 0.02 m3/s (∆T = 12K) to 0.034 m3/s (∆T = 7K). With once-through\ncooling, low end temperatures can be reached with a corresponding approach of 3-5K.\nEnvironmental aspects\nFor once-through systems the major environmental aspects mentioned are:\n• \nthe use of large amounts of water\n• \nheat emission,\n• \nthe risk of fish intake,\n• \nsensitivity to bio-fouling, scaling or corrosion\n• \nthe use of additives and the resulting emissions to water,\n• \nenergy consumption, mainly for pumps,\n• \nthe risk of leakage from the process stream, and\n• \nthe silting-up of sieves at water intake.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nApplication\nOnce-through systems are used by large industrial processes such as the power generating\nindustry, chemical industry and refineries. The water used for once-through cooling is mostly\nsurface water. For smaller scale uses, such as pump cooling, tap water or groundwater is also\nused. A reliable source of water near the site and at a suitably low temperature is an essential\ncondition for once-through systems. The quality of the surface water and the discharge limits\ncan also affect the applicability, but generally water quality and water chemistry are less\nrestrictive than in the case of recirculating systems. [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996]\n2.3.2 Once-through cooling systems with cooling tower\nBecause of the power generating process operates under vacuum conditions, leakage in the\ncondenser of a power plant generally means pollution of the process-water by the cooling water.\nOn a number of sites, once-through systems can be found combined with a cooling tower to\nprecool the discharge before it is emitted into the receiving surface water. This configuration is\napplied in situations where cooling water may recirculate and raise the temperature of the\ncooling water intake of the same plant or other industries. River capacity, tidal movement,\nplant-size and temperature of the surface water are also factors. This kind of precooling can be\nfound at coastal power stations (estuaries) and inland at riverbanks.\nEnvironmental aspects of open wet cooling towers will apply to these cooling systems.\nBiological growth and deposits have to be considered when choosing cooling tower fill. In\ngeneral, cooling towers with wide spread fill or splash fills are applied.\nFigure 2.2: Schematic representation of a direct once-through cooling system with a cooling tower\napplied in power industry\n[tm132, Eurelectric, 1998]\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n2.3.3 Indirect once-through cooling systems\nFigure 2.3: Schematic representation of an indirect once-through cooling system\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nTechnical description\nThis cooling configuration is similar to the direct once-through system, but is indirect because\nthere is no direct transfer from the process fluid/vapor to the coolant that is discharged. Here,\nthe term secondary cooling system is also used. Heat is transferred from the process medium or\nproduct to a coolant that circulates in a closed circuit (t3 and t4). The coolant in this secondary\ncooling circuit transfers its heat via heat exchangers to the coolant (e.g. surface water) that flows\nthrough the heat exchangers only once, the so-called primary cooling water (t1 and t2). This\nwater is directly discharged into the surface water, whereas the secondary coolant remains in the\nclosed circuit.\nCooling capacity\nWith indirect once-through cooling, the same low end temperatures can be reached, but due to\nthe extra heat exchanger the approach can increase by another 3-5K, depending on the\nefficiency of the heat exchanger.\nEnvironmental aspects\nSee also direct OTS. The design means that the risk of discharge of leaked process fluids to the\nsurface water is of minimal or zero.\nApplication\nThe indirect once-through cooling water system is used where there is a high environmental risk\nif process fluids leak into the cooling water. Availability and quality of the surface water are\nalso important for this cooling system. This system also creates a thermal load in the receiving\nsurface water. A variant of the indirect once-through system is to recycle a part of the water of\nthe primary cycle. This part is cooled by air before it is mixed with new incoming cooling\nwater. This extra cooling capacity can be used in periods of the year when insufficient cooling\nwater is available.\nGenerally, as a result of the extra heat exchanger (i.e. higher approach) the process end\ntemperatures that can be reached are not as low as with direct once-through cooling.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n2.4 Open recirculating cooling systems\nFigure 2.4: Schematic representation of an open recirculating system\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nTechnical description\nOpen recirculating cooling systems are also referred to as open evaporative cooling systems. In\nthese systems, cooling water that is led through the heat exchanger(s) systems is cooled down in\na cooling tower where the majority of the heat is discharged to the environment. In the cooling\ntower the heated water is distributed over the cooling tower fill and is cooled by contact with air\nand collected in a reservoir, after which it is pumped back to the heat to be reused as a coolant.\nThe air movement is created naturally or by means of fans that push or pull the air through the\ntower. Cooling of the water is a result of evaporation of a small part of the cooling water and of\nsensible heat loss by the direct cooling of water by air, also called convection. The wet and dry\nbulb temperatures largely influence the level at which these systems can operate.\nMost, but not all of the water that is cooled in the tower is recirculated and can be used as\ncooling water again. The main causes of water loss are evaporation, blowdown (windage, drift,\npurge (intentional blowdown) and leaks. Intentional blowdown is the draining of water from the\ncircuit necessary to avoid thickening of the cooling water (Annex VI). To compensate for the\nblowdown and evaporation, water is added and this is the so-called make-up. Generally, the\nmake-up water flow used by an open recirculating system is about 1-3% of the flow of a once-\nthrough system with the same cooling capacity. For the power industry this can be 1-5%. This is\nequal to a requirement of approximately “0.25% x cooling range”, which is the make-up water\nquantity as a percentage of the circulating water flow. Blowdown generally ranges from 0.15-\n0.80 m3/s per 1000 MWth cooled. (Water-half time varies between one hour and four days.)\nThis system requires sufficient quantities of water available all year around and generally\ncooling water treatment is necessary.\nCooling capacity\nOpen recirculating systems are mainly used for industrial applications with a heat capacity\nranging from 1-100 MWth, but also for power stations with much larger capacities. These\nsystems are mostly applied inland where insufficient water is available, or where no further rise\nof the water temperature of the receiving water is acceptable, a situation found alongside rivers\nwith low flows in warm summer months [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996]. Wet cooling\ntowers transfer to the atmosphere about 80% of the residual heat in the form of latent heat\n(water vapour) and about 20% by sensible heat [tm132, Eurelectric, 1998]. Approaches of 4K\nare technically and economically achievable between 15 and 30ºC. Approaches and minimum\nend temperatures depend on the climatic conditions on site.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nEnvironmental aspects\nThe environmental aspects of recirculating systems depend particularly on the type of cooling\ntower and the way it is operated. They are:\n• \ncooling water additives and their emission through the blowdown to surface water,\n• \nuse of energy for pumps and fans,\n• \nemissions into air,\n• \nplume formation, condensation and ice-formation,\n• \nnoise,\n• \nwaste due to replacement of cooling tower fill, and\n• \nhuman health aspects.\nApplication\nRecirculating systems are applied in a wide range of processes. One feature is the reduction of\nheat load to a receiving waterway by changing the direction of the discharged waste heat from\nthe surface water to the air. Another feature is the reduction of the amount of water used for\ncooling. A common practice therefore is the modification of once-through cooling systems into\nopen evaporative cooling systems by applying one or more cooling towers.\nOpen recirculating configurations are:\n- \nopen wet cooling towers\n- \nopen hybrid or wet/dry cooling towers\n2.4.1 Natural draught wet cooling towers\nConstruction\nLarge towers nowadays are shell type and made of reinforced concrete. The constructions are\nmostly hyperbolic-rotational shells having advantages in thermodynamic/statical aspects.\nInvestment costs are high, whereas operational costs are comparatively low. Natural draught wet\ncooling towers are commonly used for large power stations and large industrial plants.\nWater distribution system\nThe water returning from the heat exchanger is brought into the tower using a water distribution\nsystem. This system creates fine droplets or a water film. Uniform distribution enhances the heat\nexchange. Options are offered for partial operation of the water distribution system to lower the\ncooling capacity if needed. Also, winter operating modes are offered based on preheating of the\ncooling air.\nCooling tower fill\nThe fill section is the important part of each open wet tower, creating the contact surface for the\nexchange of heat from water to air. There can be film fill or splash type fill. Film fill usually\nconsists of closely packed, corrugated, vertical sheets or sheets of organic materials, which\ncause the water to flow down through the tower in a very thin film. This fill is very efficient and\ncan be used for most applications. Some types may require a certain water quality, because they\nare susceptible to fouling.\nSplash type fill can be found in different configurations and can be made of a variety of\nmaterials (e.g. wood). Splash fill has a much lower efficiency than film fill, but is used\nparticularly situations where the water is heavily contaminated or of poor quality, where film fill\nwould have problems due to a contaminated surface. Where the suspended matter content is\nhigh, fibre cement sheets are also used.\nDrift eliminators\nTo save water, drift eliminators are installed above the water distributors to prevent the water\ndroplets from being entrained by the airflow. Nowadays, drift eliminators are made of a number\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nof materials, such as plastic or fibre cement, and designed in such a way that they cause minimal\npressure drop.\nCharacteristics of natural draught wet cooling towers:\n- \nairflow is a result of air density differences and of shape of tower as in a chimney\nconstruction;\n- \nheight is considerable (80-200 m.); [construction height as obstacle for people, aviation,\nelectronic transmissions and plumes];\n- \nthere is no energy requirement for fans, unless fan assisted, which enables lower heights;\n- \nit is designed with counter flow and internal fill, or cross flow and external fill (see Figure\n2.5 and Figure 2.6);\n- \nit requires a base load operation, i.e. tower being in operation for more than 60 % of the\nyear in operation\n- \nit is generally applied for a rejected heat capacity of more than 200 MWth, i.e. large plants\nsuch as power stations or large chemical plants;\n- \nit offers an option for desulphurized flue gas discharge, using the cooling tower as stack\navoiding reheating of the flue gas required for environmental reasons;\nFigure 2.5: Natural draught wet cooling tower counter flow\n[tm103, BDAG, 1996]\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nFigure 2.6: Natural draught wet cooling tower cross flow\n[tm010, Betz, 1991]\n2.4.2 Mechanical draught wet cooling towers\nConstruction\nMechanical draught cooling towers are applied in different types of constructions. A wide\nvariety of materials is used for construction of these cooling towers, depending on size and type\nand the requirements with respect to the location, service life and capital expenditure. Larger\nones can be built of reinforced concrete, smaller ones can vary considerably, but mostly consist\nof synthetic material, steel plate, clad steel constructions and in-situ or pre-cast concrete. For\nrelatively smaller towers (5 MWth) timber is still in use; it is cheaper, can be built at any time of\nthe year and can be quicker to build than concrete towers.\nIt is also possible to use a modular system, i.e. several towers in parallel, in the same concrete\nstructure. In this way the system can be operated in the most economical way, choosing the\nnumber of elements in operation, depending on ambient conditions and on the amount of heat.\nMaterials and type of construction and design affect the environmental performance of the\ncooling tower. Referring to shape and size or brand, a variety of names is used in the literature\ndescribing the use and application of these towers. Examples are the circular cooling tower and\ncell type cooling towers both in forced and induced draught designs.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nDesign of equipment for water distribution, fill and drift elimination can be different to that\nof the natural draught wet cooling tower, but the working principles are the same.\nFigure 2.7: Fan assisted natural draught cooling tower\n[tm103, BDAG, 1996]\nFans\nMechanical cooling towers use fans to create the airflow and consequently can be much smaller\nthan the large natural draught type. A large number of different fan types is applied in\nmechanical cooling towers (dry, wet or hybrid). Depending on the requirements, fans vary in\nfan diameter, blade size and position (radial or axial). Additionally, one-speed or multi-speed\ndrives enable flexible operation. The choice of the fan type and the drives will affect the energy\ndemand and the sound emission level of the cooling tower. Depending on the way the airflow is\ncreated distinction is made between forced and induced towers.\nThe fan-assisted tower is a special design used in a number of cases where the local situation\nrequires a lower tower.\n2.4.2.1 Forced draught wet cooling towers\nCharacteristics of the forced draught cooling tower:\n- \nfans at the base of the cooling tower push air through the tower;\n- \nthermal performance is adjustable in steps or modulating;\n- \nsingle-and multi-fan designs are applied;\n- \nthe cooling tower size is limited, requiring less space than a natural draught tower;\n- \ntower can be adapted to surrounding terrain (rooftop installation);\n- \ndirect energy consumption is assumed to be low;\n- \nit is usually designed with counter flow design;\n- \nit can be designed for a wide variety of applications: for peak load and high heat rejection\nand from base load to medium load operating standard;\n- \nit is applied for a rejected heat capacity from less than 100 kWth to a heat capacity of more\nthan approximately 100 MWth;\n- \ncapital investment is low compared to natural draught towers;\n- \nwhen using mechanical draught cooling towers, regulations with regard to emission of\nnoise, moisture (plume) and bacteria are to be observed.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nFigure 2.8: Schematic representation of a forced draught tower with counter flow design\n[tm010, Betz, 1991]\n2.4.2.2 Induced draught wet cooling towers\nCharacteristics of the induced draught cooling tower:\n- \nfans at the top of the cooling tower construction pull air through the tower;\n- \nthermal performance is controllable within limits,\n- \na relatively simple construction is preferred (prefabricated elements, off-the-peg product),\n- \nthe cooling tower size is limited, requiring less space than a natural draught tower;\n- \ncooling capacity can be enlarged by working with several sections\n- \ntower can be adapted to surrounding terrain (rooftop construction);\n- \ncost of direct energy consumption is assumed to be low,\n- \ndesigned with counter flow or cross flow,\n- \nit is used for a wide variety of applications: for peak load and high heat rejection and from\nbase load to medium load operating standard; it is applied for a rejected heat capacity from\napproximately 100 MWth,\n- \ncapital investment is low compared to natural draught towers,\n- \nwhen using mechanical draught cooling towers regulations with regard to emission of noise,\nmoisture (plume) and bacteria are to be observed.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFigure 2.9: Schematic presentation of a cell type induced draught cooling tower, cross flow design\n[tm010, Betz, 1991]\n2.5 Closed circuit cooling systems\n2.5.1 Air-cooled cooling systems\nIn air-cooled cooling systems (or dry cooling systems) the substance (fluid, vapour) is circulated\nthrough coils, tubes or conduits, which are cooled by a passing air stream. Generally dry air\ncooling has the following applications:\n- \ncooling of medium of nearly any chemical composition can be applied, requiring\nappropriate heat exchanger material only;\n- \nin situations where cooling tower make-up water is not available or for a short period of\ntime only and\n- \nwhere formation of plume is not admissible.\nTechnical description\nDepending on the application, closed circuit dry air-cooled systems consist of (finned) tube\nelements, coils or conduits of a condenser, fans with drives and a carrying steel construction or a\ntower. The process medium itself or a coolant (indirect system) is circulated through the tubes.\nAn air stream is created, naturally or by fans, that flows past the tubes thus cooling the medium\nby conduction and convection. In almost all cases the air flows crosswise through the heat\nexchanger. The process medium passes the heat exchanger in a 'one-pass' or a 'multi-pass'\nconfiguration.\nThe process medium is a fluid, the cooling system is called an air-cooled fluid cooler. If a\nvapour (gas or refrigerant) is directly cooled down to condense to liquid, the cooling system is\ncalled an air-cooled condenser. Application can be in a mechanical or natural draught design.\nA wide variety of corrosion-resistant materials is used for construction. The options for\nconstruction are numerous. Air cooling systems can be found as large independent units as well\nas smaller rooftop units. They can be horizontal, roof type rectangular, vertical or as a V-\nconstruction to suit the plant layout requirements.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nCooling capacity\nIn practice, air-cooling is often used to cool process flows at a high temperature level (>80ºC)\ndown to a level at which water-cooling becomes more appropriate. The driving force of the heat\nexchange is the temperature difference between the cooling air and the process flow. The\nmaximum design temperature of the cooling air may in practice only be exceeded a few hours\nper year. The design temperature depends on dry-bulb temperature and climatic conditions are\nvery important.\nBecause the heat capacity of air is low (1.0 kJ/kg.K) and the coefficient of conduction and\nconvection is low, a lot of air is needed and a larger heat exchanging surface is required than\nwith water cooling. For this reason, fins are often placed on the pipe surface to increase the\neffective heat exchange surface. Based on economic considerations a minimum approach of 10-\n15ºC is used in the design of air coolers. This generally results in higher end temperatures\n(minimum 40-45ºC), although in areas where higher ambient air temperatures occur, the\napproaches and the end temperatures exceed the average values mentioned in Table 2.1 and\nTable 2.2. For indirect configurations the approach (13-20ºC) and the achievable end\ntemperatures (50-60ºC) will increase accordingly.\nEnvironmental aspects\nThe major environmental aspects are noise and energy use for driving the fans. No water is\nbeing used, unless it is used as secondary coolant in an indirect design. However, being closed,\nthis water requires little or no maintenance.\nCleaning of the outside of the (finned) tubes is necessary and sometimes problems can arise due\nto the accumulation of airborne debris and small insects.\nApplication\nDry air-cooled heat exchangers are applied in a wide variety of industries in small and large\nsizes. They are applied for product cooling in the chemical and petrochemical industries, for\nvacuum condensation in power stations and for exhaust cooling.\nFor the same capacity, dry air-cooling needs a larger surface than a wet cooling system and dry\nsystems are generally considered to be more expensive. In the power industry, dry air-cooling is\ntherefore considered in specific situations where power generation is planned at locations with\ninsufficient water supply for wet cooling.\n2.5.1.1 Natural draught dry cooling tower\nCharacteristics of a natural draught dry cooling tower are:\n- \nbase load operation, i.e. more than 60% of the year in operation,\n- \nheat rejection more than 200 MWth, i.e. large plants such as power stations, large chemical\nplants, etc.,\n- \napplication in situations where absolutely noiseless operation is required,\n- \napplication in situations where cooling tower make-up water is not available or available for\na short period of time only.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFigure 2.10: Schematic presentation of principle of a dry natural draught cooling tower\n[Eurovent, 2000]\nFigure 2.11: Example of natural draught dry cooling tower for a power plant application\n[VGB, 2000]\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n2.5.1.2 Air-cooled liquid cooling systems\nCharacteristics of an air-cooled liquid cooler tower are:\n- \nthermal performance adjustable by fan control;\n- \nclosed circuit necessary;\n- \nforced and induced draught both applied;\n- \ncost of internal power consumption assumed to be higher than for wet cooling towers;\n- \nlow heat rejection, i.e. less than 100 MWth;\n- \nchange in cooling medium temperature nearly linearly to the (dry bulb) air temperature must\nbe acceptable for the process to be cooled;\n- \noperating costs nearly entirely consisting of energy costs;\n- \nenvironmental aspects in particular are noise and energy.\nFigure 2.12: Schematic presentation of the principle of a dry air-cooled cooling system\n[Courtesy of Eurovent, 2000]\nFigure 2.13: Example of a dry air-cooled liquid cooler in a chemical process\n[Pers. archive]\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n2.5.1.3 Air-cooled steam condensers\nAir-cooled condensers (see Annex XII) are widely applied in the power industry and chemical\nplants for condensation of steam. The air is drawn in by fans under the condenser elements and\npushed through. The passing air cools down the steam entering the condenser tube bundles (see\nFigure 2.14). In an indirect system the condenser is cooled by a cooling water stream which in\nturn is cooled in a natural draught cooling tower.\nCharacteristics of air-cooled steam condensers are:\n- \nheat rejection for small to large installations,\n- \nno cooling water needed,\n- \ncost of direct energy consumption is assumed to be higher then for wet condensers or wet\ncooling towers,\n- \nrequires relatively low overall height,\n- \nshort exhaust steam pipes possible,\n- \nconsiderable space requirement in the immediate vicinity of the steam generator,\n- \nadaptation to load and temperature variations necessary over large ranges, which requires\nvariable fan speed operation,\n- \nenvironmental aspects in particular are noise and energy.\nFigure 2.14: Schematic presentation of the principle of a direct air-cooled condenser\n[Balcke Dürr, 2000]\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nFigure 2.15: Example of an air-cooled condenser for condensation of turbine exhaust steam\n[tm111, BDAG, 1996]\n2.5.2 Closed circuit wet cooling systems\nIn closed circuit cooling systems, the medium to be cooled is circulated in a closed circuit\nwithout contact with the environment. The medium is led through a coil (primary circuit). The\ncoils are wetted from the outside (secondary or spray circuit). The heat is conducted from the\nmedium to the spray water (sensible heat transfer). The evaporation of a small part of the water\nleads to evaporative cooling and the heat is transferred from the water to the air. There is an\nadditional sensible heat transfer from the coil to the air. In practice at evaporative cooling\nsensible and latent heat transfer are always coupled. The wetting water is treated to avoid\ndamage to the equipment. Evaporative losses, drift and windage cause concentration, so some\nde-sludging (blowdown) is needed and some make-up water has to be added.\nCooling capacity\nThe heat transfer capability is lower than for open systems due to the lower heat transfer\ncapacity of the coil. By combinations of units, larger capacities of 150-400 kWth to 2.5 MWth\ncan be achieved. Approaches of 4 K are typically achievable. The advantage is a contaminant-\nfree closed primary cooling loop (true for all closed cooling), which in some cases eliminates\nthe need for internal heat exchangers. In terms of resources, the energy requirements for the\nspray water loop have to be considered. With closed circuit cooling, end temperatures between\n25-30°C are achievable, depending on the climatic conditions of the site [tm139, Eurovent,\n1998]\nTemperatures in the water film at heat exchanger surfaces are up to 5°C higher than the\ntemperatures of the bulk water, which typically range from 40 to 50°C, although temperatures\nup to 70-80 °C can also be encountered in practice.\nEnvironmental aspects\nIf closed circuit cooling systems use water as a secondary cooling medium, this is generally\nalkalised demineralised water or potable water. Residence times in these systems can be up to 6\nmonths. Make-up water is needed only when leakage and evaporation have occurred at pump\npackings or when water has been drained to allow system repairs. Because only little make-up\nwater is needed, this can usually be of high quality, and as a result, scale deposits are not a\nproblem. Scaling can be caused by the water used on the outside of the tubes or coils and\ntreatment (cleaning) may be needed. [tm010, Betz, 1991]. Depending on the technical concept,\nthe mode of operation and the climatic conditions, plume formation may occur. Water can be\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nsaved, as the tower can be operated as a dry tower when the ambient temperatures are low. Fan\nnoise may be an issue.\nApplication\nClosed circuit cooling systems are used in many applications. They are well suited to the\ncooling of gas engines and compressors and can provide a reliable method of industrial process\ntemperature control [tm010, Betz, 1991]. They can be applied for both large and small\napplications. Applications can be found as liquid coolers (e.g. lubricating oils, cooling water for\ncompressors), as gas coolers (e.g. diesel engines, process gas) and as air-cooled condensers\n(combined cycle plants, steam turbines).\nIf the process medium in the coil or tubes is a vapour (gas or refrigerant) to be cooled down to\ncondense into liquid, this cooling system is also called an evaporative condenser.\n2.5.2.1 Mechanical draught wet closed circuit cooling systems\nCharacteristics of the mechanical draught wet closed circuit cooling systems:\n-\nheat rejection for small to large installations,\n-\nlow cooling temperatures can be achieved,\n-\ncompact design compared to air-cooled equipment,\n-\nlow energy requirements,\n-\nneed for water supply and spray water circuit,\n-\nplume suppression achievable by air discharge plume abatement coils and/or dry\noperation in winter,\n-\nenvironmental aspects, in particular water treatment and effluent disposal.\nFigure 2.16: Schematic presentation of the principle of a closed recirculating wet cooling tower with\ninduced draught\n[Eurovent, 2000]\n2.5.2.2 Evaporative steam condensers\nCharacteristics of evaporative steam condensers:\n-\nheat rejection for medium to large installations,\n-\nlower condensing temperatures than with air-cooled steam condensers,\n-\nlow energy requirements,\n-\ngenerally higher than air-cooled steam condensers but with a smaller footprint,\n-\nenvironmental aspects in particular are water treatment and effluent disposal.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n2.6 Combined wet/dry cooling systems\n2.6.1 Open wet/dry (hybrid) cooling towers\nTechnical description\nThe open wet/dry cooling tower or hybrid cooling tower is a special design that has been\ndeveloped as an important solution to the problem of cooling water use and of plume formation.\nIt is a combination of a 'wet' and 'dry' cooling tower or, in other words, of an evaporative and a\nnon-evaporative process. The hybrid cooling tower can be operated either as a pure wet cooling\ntower or as a combined wet/dry cooling tower, depending on the ambient temperature. The\nheated cooling water first passes through a dry section of the cooling tower, where part of the\nheat load is removed by an air current, which is often induced by a fan. After passing the dry\nsection, water is further cooled in the wet section of the tower, which functions similarly to an\nopen recirculating tower. The heated air from the dry section is mixed with the vapour from the\nwet section in the upper part of the tower, thus lowering the relative humidity before the air\ncurrent leaves the cooling tower, which (almost) completely reduces plume formation above the\ntower.\nOptimising the effect of a hybrid cooling tower means optimising the amount of dry heat\ntransfer to meet the plume control requirements. At the same time the wet section is being used\nfor the major part of the cooling.\nFigure 2.17: Schematic representation of hybrid cooling tower principle (example applied in power\nindustry)\n[Eurelectric, 1999]\nCharacteristics of open hybrid cooling towers are:\n- \nbase load and partial load operation for all capacities\n- \ncooling medium being water only\n- \ncooling tower make-up water required for most of the operating time\n- \nthermal performance being the same as in the case of wet cooling towers\n- \nreduction in make-up water quantity\n- \nregulations for environmental protection, e.g. reduction in overall height (due to fan\nassistance) and plume abatement\n- \nsound attenuation equipment required due to noise regulations.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTo operate a hybrid cooling tower efficiently a number of devices are used:\n- \nvariable speed fans\n- \nclosing devices for air inlet openings (such as louvres or sliding gates)\n- \nvalves for water flows to the wet and dry sections\n- \nbypass systems\n- \nbooster pumps (for special constructions)\n- \nsystem for mixing of the wet plume with dry plume.\nHybrid tower construction\nCurrently only mechanical draught type hybrid cooling towers are available. The hybrid cooling\ntower is different from the characteristic open wet tower design in that it has a dry and a wet\nsection, each with its own air inlet and corresponding fans. Hybrid cooling towers can be found\nas package cooling towers, large round cooling towers with forced draught fans or as cell-type\ncooling towers with induced draught fans. Fill, water distribution system, drift elimination, and\nsound attenuation are features common to both tower designs.\nWet/dry cooling towers of the mechanical draught type are fitted with internal mixing systems\nto mix the wet and dry airflows. They can be automatically controlled according to the heat\nload, water flow, ambient air and plume conditions.\nCooling capacity\nThey can be built as package cooling towers, induced draught or forced draught cooling towers\nand – on a larger scale - as cooling towers of the cellular type or circular type with the heat\nrejection ranging from < 1 MWth up to 2500 MWth.\nEnvironmental aspects\nThe major difference between a hybrid cooling tower and a conventional cooling tower is its\ncomparatively lower water use (which is make-up water) amounting to 20% less than that of a\nwet cooling tower [tm132, Eurelectric, 1998].\nThe resulting annual energy consumption of a mechanical draught hybrid cooling tower can be\nreduced to a level of 1.1 to 1.5 times that of a comparable mechanical draught wet cooling tower\nsince in nominal conditions, airflow is almost double (wet and dry sections). Natural draught\ncooling towers of the wet/dry design are under consideration.\nApplication\nA decision to install a hybrid cooling tower is made in the light of site-specific requirements\n(limitation of height and plume reduction) and several can be found in the power industry,\nespecially in Germany and in United Kingdom (in cogeneration systems). Its use is restricted to\ntemperature ranges of 25-55ºC, because above 55ºC precipitation of calcium carbonate is\nobserved to occur more easily on the tubes. This does not mean that no precipitation occurs\nbelow 55ºC and some care must be taken in using this as a rule of thumb.\n2.6.2 Closed circuit hybrid cooling systems\nTechnical description\nFor closed circuit cooling hybrid systems, characteristics can be described in a similar way as\nfor closed recirculating wet cooling systems concerning fans (axial and radial), airflow direction\n(cross or counterflow) and noise abatement systems (see § 2.4). Generally, these units have a\nsmall space requirement. Three technical modes can be applied to closed circuit hybrid cooling\ntowers: sprayed finned coils, adiabatic cooling or combined systems.\nEnvironmental aspects\nClosed circuit hybrid cooling towers combine the advantages of closed loop cooling with\nsignificant savings of water when compared to conventional closed circuit wet cooling towers.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nCompared to closed circuit dry cooling towers they offer the advantage of lower cooling\ntemperatures. In terms of size, energy consumption and noise emission they compare with\nconventional closed circuit wet cooling towers. Depending on their design (sprayed finned\ncoils) special attention may need to be paid to the quality of the water treatment. Additional\ncosts can be more than offset by the significant saving of water, as such products require the use\nof water only during a very short period of the year. Closed circuit hybrid coolers also\nsignificantly suppress and, in some designs, even eliminate plume formation.\n2.6.2.1 Sprayed (finned) coils\nFigure 2.18: Schematic presentation of the principle of a closed circuit hybrid cooling tower\nIn a closed circuit cooling tower the process medium runs through cooling elements (a\ntube/plate bank or the finned coil) in a closed loop, the primary cooling circuit. These cooling\nelements are wetted via a secondary water circuit and air is simultaneously moved over the\nelements to create evaporative heat. The cooling water that runs off the elements is collected in\na basin and can be recirculated a number of times, sometimes using another cooling tower or\nafter blowdown (see Figure 2.19). In an indirect configuration, the medium that runs through the\nprimary cooling circuit is not the process medium but another coolant which in turn cools the\nprocess medium in a second heat exchanger.\n2.6.2.2 Adiabatic coolers, wetting and pre-cooling the air that cools the coils\nIn the adiabatic mode the fluid to be cooled bypasses the prime surface coil. The cooling water\ntrickles down the wet deck and the air passing the deck is wetted with as much moisture as it\ncan take up. The wetted air passes the finned coils and will take up more heat than dry air would\ndo. Compared to conventional evaporative cooling equipment the water consumption is much\nreduced. (See Figure 2.19)\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFigure 2.19: Combined dry/wet operation of a hybrid cooling system\n[tm151, BAC, 1999]\n2.6.2.3 Combined technology\nIn combined technology the finned coils, the sprayed prime surface coil and the wet deck are all\nused. In the dry mode it is then possible to close all water sprays and lead the medium to be\ncooled through both the finned coils and the prime surface coils, both cooled by dry air only. In\nthe wet/dry mode the medium after passing the dry coils passes the sprayed prime surface coils\nbefore returning to the process as cooled medium. The warmed water trickling down from the\nprime coils will fall over the wet deck surface. Air is drawn in and passes both the prime surface\ncoil and wet deck surface, where it is saturated and picks up heat. As it passes the finned coil\nmore heat can be picked up (see also Figure 2.19).\n2.6.2.4 Costs of hybrid systems\nIn the application of hybrid systems reference is always made to the investment and operating\ncosts involved. In general hybrid systems require higher investment costs. Costs of plume\nsuppression vary depending on the cooling system. Compared to a cooling tower with the same\ncooling performance, Fluor [1995] calculated that for an open wet cooling tower installation of\n300 MW the cooling installation costs are about 2.5 times as high as for cooling towers without\nplume suppression. For closed circuit wet cooling towers, costs for plume suppression are\nreported to be 1.5 to 2 times as high as for towers without plume suppression (Eurovent). The\ncosts have to be adjusted for cost savings on water intake and operational flexibility. The annual\ncosts for water, including water treatment and electricity can represent in some cases just about\n10 % of the annual costs of a cooling tower. These economic considerations depend of course\non the individual application and the prices of water and energy [tm139, Eurovent, 1998]\nCost indications by the power industry show levels of EUR 40000 to 70000 per MWth for\nmechanical draught type hybrid cooling towers. In this sector this means an installation cost\nlevel of 1.3-1.6 times that of towers of similar capacity without plume suppression.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n2.7 Recirculating cooling systems\nThe descriptions given above of major cooling configurations explain the cooling principles and\nthe different associated technical designs that are applied in industry, depending on\nrequirements of process, site and environment. Some key definitions have been explained in the\nintroduction as well as the difference between dry and evaporative cooling, and between open\nand closed systems is used in the systems’ descriptions. The application of the criteria direct and\nindirect, however, can lead to much confusion if they are not defined in the context of\nrecirculating cooling systems.\n2.7.1 Direct recirculating cooling systems\nAs stated earlier, in direct cooling systems there is only one heat exchanger level where coolant\nand process medium exchange heat and where the coolant (water or air) is in contact with the\nenvironment. Leakage through the wall between process medium and coolant (air or water)\nwould therefore mean that process medium is discharged into the environment or that, in\nvacuum conditions (condensers), the process is affected. Thus, although the cooling of the\ncoolant as it is done in a cooling tower is also a process of heat exchange, it is still considered a\ndirect system.\nThe example of the open cooling tower cooling the water circuit of a water-cooled condenser is\ntherefore a direct system (although, as mentioned, leakage will affect the process rather than the\ncoolant).\n2.7.2 Indirect recirculating cooling systems\nThe key element to define an indirect system would be that leakage of the process would not\ncontaminate the coolant that is in open connection with the environment. This means two levels\nof cooling.\nIn the case of an open recirculating cooling tower, the water leaving the tower would exchange\nheat in a heat exchanger with water that is in a closed loop. The water in the closed loop will\nleave this heat exchanger to enter another heat exchanger, where it exchanges heat with the\nprocess medium.\nIn closed recirculating cooling towers the same principle is followed and the coils or tubes are\nfilled with water, which is cooled by water and /or air. The cooled water enters a heat exchanger\nor a condenser within process to exchange heat with the process medium.\nWhere closed recirculating cooling systems operate in winter and need protection against\nfreezing, the closed circle usually contains not just water, but also a refrigerant or water mixed\nwith anti-freeze. In fact, those systems can again be classified as direct systems as the\nrefrigerant could pollute the cooling medium, which is in open contact with the environment.\n2.8 Costs of cooling systems\nFor each configuration a cost indication has been given, but calculations made of the costs of\ncooling systems show a wide variation and it can be concluded that the differences in costs\nbetween the different systems do not necessarily indicate the least expensive variant. Of the\ndifferent factors that in the end influence the costs, the users’ requirements and the legal\nrequirements are very important. For this reason an estimate of the feasibility of a system or the\napplication of a technique should be made for each individual case. Energy prices always have\nto be taken into account. They will be important, for instance, in those cases where heat\nrecovery is being considered.\n\nChapter 2\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nAn important aspect in calculating the costs of a cooling system and of the possible\nimprovements is the comparison between the initial investment costs of a system or an applied\nmeasure and the resulting annual costs. In practice, high investment costs can lead to lower\nmaintenance costs, but also to higher annual fixed costs, which can be an obstacle to investment\nitself. For the sake of comparison, costs also have to be expressed in terms of the heat capacity\nthe system is designed for (kWth or MWth).\nFor industrial (non-power plant) applications [tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997] listed a number of cost-\ndetermining elements for both water-cooled and air-cooled systems, calculated total costs and\ncompared the different systems. The elements and the approach followed are explained below\nand the results have been summarised in Annex X. For power plants a different model applies,\nwhich is explained in Annex XII.\nElements\nGenerally the following cost-determining elements have to be taken into account:\nTable 2.3: Cost elements for water and air cooling systems\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nCost type\nCost elements\nWater cooling\nsystems\nAir cooling systems\nFixed\nHeat exchanger(s) (type, size and\nmodel)\nx\nx\nHeat exchanger (material)\nx\nx\nPipelines in process, tube-bridges\nx\nx\nPumps/reserve pumps\nx\nx\nInlet facilities\nx\nTube intake/drainage\nx\nOutflow facilities\nx\nCooling tower(s) (possible)\nx\nx\nFans\nx\nx\nSound attenuation\nx\nx\nIndirect system (extra heat exchanger,\npipes, pumps)\nx\nx\nVariable\nWater (groundwater, tap water)\nx\nWater discharge fee\nx\nLeakage monitoring\nx\nx\nWater conditioning\nx\nEnergy consumption (pumps and fans)\nx\nx\nMaintenance\nx\nx\nMethodology\nDifferent methodologies have been developed for cost comparisons between different cooling\nsystems. The method used is described briefly in Annex X.\nComparisons\nComparisons should always be made based on the same operational conditions and for the same\ncapacity and expressed per MWth dissipated.\nCalculations have shown that cost sensitivity is to a large extent determined by the investment\nlevel and the consumption of energy. The variation in the costs of heat exchangers (shell &\ntube) due to the chosen configuration and to the choice of material is very important. Cheap\nmaterials and models determine the calculated lower limits. Special materials determine the\nupper limit. It should not be forgotten here that good materials could considerably decrease the\ncosts of maintenance and operating and of the use of chemicals.\n\nChapter 2\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nCalculated as annual costs, investments and operational costs differ significantly. Factors such\nas (make-up) water requirement and price, and energy consumption are influential. The choice\nof material also has consequences for the annual costs. Where dry air-cooling is applied, the\nachievable end temperature is important and the lower the required end temperature, the more\nexpensive air-cooling will become. With water cooling, the low endtemperature is less\nimportant for cost estimations, unless small approaches are used in the calculation.\nTable X.2 in Annex X shows the ranges of costs of various large industrial cooling systems.\nFrom the data used in this method the operational costs of an open wet cooling tower were\nshown to be higher than for dry air-cooling. The investment costs for air cooling, on the other\nhand, were generally higher than for the other systems. It further suggests that, particularly with\ncooling water systems, higher investment can mean lower operational costs (maintenance,\nconditioning).\nOn the basis of the above data, it can be concluded that the cost differences between different\nsystems do not necessarily indicate the least expensive variant. This clearly depends on the\nusers' requirements and the requirements on emission levels set by the authorities. For this\nreason an estimate of what is feasible should be made for each individual case. The above data\ncan be used as initial (general) indications and are illustrated in Annex X.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3 ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS OF INDUSTRIAL COOLING\nSYSTEMS AND APPLIED PREVENTION AND REDUCTION\nTECHNIQUES\n3.1 Introduction\nThe environmental aspects of industrial cooling systems are different for each of the\nconfigurations described in Chapter 2. Direct and indirect energy consumption, emissions of\nheat and cooling water additives to the surface water, noise and plume formation are\nenvironmental aspects of cooling systems. In every case, the environmental importance of these\nissues (such as noise) should always be considered in the light of the total environmental\nperformance including that of the industrial process to be cooled. Not all issues are equally\nimportant for every system, such as water requirements or plume formation, which play no role\nin dry cooling systems. The issues that potentially are relevant and should be taken into account\nby the permit writer in considering the industrial cooling system are qualitatively characterized\nand summarized in Table 3.1. Obviously, where appropriate measures are taken, the issue will\nbecome less relevant, but this has not been taken into account in this table as it will be part of\nthe discussion in the following chapters. The character and level of emissions to the\nenvironment are not only a result of the applied configuration, but to a large extent depend on\nthe way the system is operated and the way in which the resources that are needed to operate a\ncooling system are being managed.\nThis chapter discusses the environmental aspects and microbiological risks (or health risks) that\nmay have to be taken into account when an application for an environmental permit has to be\nconsidered. At the same time, the principles of the techniques are described that can be\nconsidered in the determination of BAT. In many cases the cooling system will be an existing\ninstallation and it is obvious that the options for improvements are limited compared to\ngreenfield situations. Generally, the design of the process and the selection of the appropriate\ncooling technology and design can reduce consumption and prevent much of the emissions to\nthe environment. In individual cases it will be a matter of setting the priorities for what should\nbe done or can be done, where site-specificity plays a major role.\nTo determine BAT, the BAT-”approach” is described separately for each environmental issue\nand each technique, taking into account potential cross-media effects. The evaluation follows\nthe general “approach” outlined in Chapter 1. It starts with reducing the demand for cooling and\nthe discharge of heat to the environment. It is followed by the assessment of options for the\nminimisation of the resources dedicated to the prevention or reduction of emissions, bearing in\nmind that this will also lead to easier cooling process operation:\n1. prevention by technological options:\n- \nintegrated technical measures\n- \nchange of configuration\n2. prevention by optimisation of systems operation\n3. application of end-of-pipe technology or additional techniques.\nThe environmental implications of each option are discussed and each technique is evaluated for\nits effect on total energy consumption. At first, it is illustrated how changes in cooling\noperations can affect energy consumption. Information on particular techniques and their\nperformances is then given in the annexes.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 3.1: Environmental issues of the different industrial cooling systems\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nEnergy\nConsumption\n(direct)\nWater\nrequirement\nFish(2)\nentrainment\nEmissions to surface\nwater\nAir\nemissions\n(direct)\nPlume\nformation\nNoise\nRisk\nResidues\nCooling system\n(§ 3.2)\n(§ 3.3)(1)\n(§ 3.3)\nHeat\n(§ 3.3)\nAdditives\n(§ 3.4)\n(§ 3.5)\n(§ 3.5)\n(§ 3.6)\nLeakage\n(§ 3.7)\nMicro\nbiol. risk\n(health)\n(§ 3.7)\n(§ 3.8)\nOnce-through cooling\n(direct circuit)\nLow\n++\n+\n++\n+\n(biocides)\n--\n--\n--\n++\n--/low\n+(6)\nOnce-through cooling\n(indirect circuit)\nLow\n++\n+\n++\n+\n(biocides)\n--\n--\n--\nLow\n--/low\n+(6)\nOpen wet cooling\ntower (direct circuit)\n+\n+\n--\nLow\n+(3)\nLow\n(in plume)\n+\n+\n+\n+\n--/low\nOpen wet cooling\ntower (indirect circuit)\n+\n+\n--\nLow\n+(3)\nLow\n(in plume)\n+\n+\nLow\n+\n+\nOpen wet/dry cooling\ntower\n+\nLow\n--\nLow\nLow(3)\n--\n--(5)\n+\nLow\n?\n+\nClosed circuit wet\ncooling tower\n+\n+\n--\n--\nLow\nLow(4)\n(in plume)\n--\n+\nLow\nLow\n--/low\nClosed circuit dry\ncooling\n++\n--\n--\n--\n--\n--/Low\n--\n++\nLow\n--\n--\nClosed circuit wet/\ndry cooling\n+\nLow\n--\n--\nLow(3)\nLow\n--\nLow\nLow\nLow\n--/low\nNotes:\n--\nnone/not relevant\nLow\nrelevance below average\n+\nrelevant\n++\nhighly relevant\n1: paragraph in text\n2: other species can also be entrained\n3: biocides, antiscaling, anticorrosion\n4: potentially in case of leakage\n5: if properly operated no issue\n6: waste refers to sludge from water intake and from decarbonization\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.2 Consumption of energy\nThe energy requirement of industrial cooling systems can be considered as a direct or an\nindirect consumption. Direct consumption is the use of energy to operate the cooling system.\nThe major energy users are pumps and fans. The higher the resistance that has to be\ncompensated to maintain the required air or water flow, the more energy a cooling system\nrequires.\nIf not properly operated, a cooling system may be indirectly responsible for an increased input\nof energy or raw material into the production process. To evaluate any change to a cooling\nsystem, the total energy balance of both the cooling system and production processes has to be\ntaken into account.\n3.2.1 Direct consumption of energy\nEnergy in cooling systems is required to pump the cooling water and/or to create airflow. It is\nexpressed in specific energy consumption as kWe per MWth dissipated heat. The specific energy\nconsumption can vary widely and depends on the configuration of the cooling system applied\n(design (approach temperatures), pumping pressure) and pattern of operation (year round, only\nsummer or winter). Local circumstances will cause variation as well, where the same cooling\nsystem in warmer climates typically requires a higher energy input than in cooler climatic\nregions. In some cases, energy is required for the on-site preparation of additives. The major\nenergy users in a cooling system are:\n• \npumps (used in all systems with cooling water) for water intake as well as for circulating the\ncooling water:\n- \ntheir energy use is determined by the flow rate, the amount of water that has to be\npumped, fall of pressure in the process (number of heat exchangers, design), place\nwhere cooling water is supplied and drained off and the medium to be pumped (gas,\nfluid, solid).\n- \nindirect systems have two circuits and will therefore need more pumps.\n- \nin the case of a cooling tower, the lift is higher, which requires more energy in\ncomparison with a once-through system.\n• \nfans for ventilation are used in all mechanical cooling towers and mechanically cooled\ncondensers:\n- \ntheir energy use is determined by the number, size and type of fans, the amount and the\nlift of the air,\n- \ndry systems in general need more air for the same cooling capacity than evaporative\n(wet) systems, although this does not necessarily lead to a higher energy consumption.\nEnergy use of associated activities\nFor an overall assessment of energy requirements of cooling systems auxiliary equipment\nessential to operate a cooling system should be included. Not many data have been reported.\nOn-site production of cooling water chemicals such as ozone is reported as a typical example,\nwhere the production of 1 kg ozone, used for antifouling purposes, varies between 7 and 20\nkWh depending on the generator. Given a minimum concentration required at the injection point\nbetween 0.5 and 1 g O3/m3 and the cooling water volume, it is possible to estimate the energy\nrequirement.\n3.2.2 Indirect consumption of energy\nThe energy consumption of the production process is referred to as the indirect energy\nconsumption caused by the cooling process. With inefficient cooling the consumption will\nincrease. A lower heat transfer (e.g. due to fouling) will raise the temperature on the process\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nside, requiring more energy, which will have to be generated on or off site. Cooling inefficiency\nleads to loss of product and will reduce the efficiency of the process.\nIn 1.2.1 and 1.4.3 the effects on temperature sensitive applications are discussed. Due to\nreduced cooling of the condenser, total energy conversion can be reduced by 0.25%, which is\nequal to a reduction of efficiency of about 0.4% per degree Celsius. If an open wet cooling\ntower is applied, rather than a once-through system, resulting in for instance a 5°C higher end\ntemperature, at maximum 2% less power will be produced. If the difference in pumping energy\nrequired for the cooling tower were taken into account (which is 6-8 kWe per MWth cooled), it\nwould cause an additional one-percent of efficiency loss. For a conventional coal fired power\nplant a 1% decrease means that efficiency would drop from 40% to 39.6%.\nThe evaluation of the environmental impact of cooling should include the evaluation of the\nindirect energy consumption. The consequences of a change in indirect energy consumption for\nthe total energy consumption can be expressed as the effect of a temperature rise on the process\nside due to suboptimal cooling. This has been calculated and compared between the major\ncooling configurations [tm059, Paping, 1995]. The data in Table 3.2 represent direct and\nindirect energy use and CO2-emissions of each cooling configuration. The three variables are\nconsidered to be a linear function of the following design parameters:\n- \ncooling water flow\n- \npumping pressure\n- \npumping efficiency (inversely proportional)\nIn this example the data are calculated with a once-through system as the reference system for\neach of the cooling principles. The once-through system has a capacity of 100 m3/hour per\nMWth (or 8.6ºC per MWth) and needs a pressure of 3 bar to pump the water to the required\nheight. This requires about 10 kWe/MWth/year with a pumping efficiency of 75%. For the\nindirect once-through system, a pressure drop occurs and 4.5 bar extra has to be generated,\nrequiring 15 kWe/MWth. A cooling tower system needs extra energy to lift the water over e.g. 8\nm and in addition to this about 7 mwg over the nozzles. Compared to a once-through cooling\nsystem, this requires an extra 4.5 bar and 15 kWe/MWth.\nFans are assumed to need 15 kWe/MWth. If they are only operated in summer (4 months) the\naverage energy required equals 5 kWe/MWth.\nIn the same table the indirect energy is expressed as a function of an increased cooling water\ninlet temperature. This will lead to an increased temperature on the process side. The factor\nrepresenting this increase is calculated as 1.4 kWe/MWthºC (see Annex II). It means that per\ndegree of increase of the temperature on the process side the required energy increases by a\nfactor 1.4.\nKnowing the total energy consumption for each cooling configuration, it is possible to express\nthis consumption in levels of emitted CO2 per discharged MWth. The energy required in power\ngeneration to produce the energy consumed by a cooling system can be calculated. With an\nassumed efficiency of 40% to generate power, each kWe input to operate the cooling system\nmust be multiplied by 2.5, expressing the energy required to discharge energy (=cooling), or\nkWe per kWe (in ‰). For each ‰ an amount of CO2 is being emitted. It is assumed that an\naverage of 2000 (1500-2500) tonnes CO2 per year per MWe (continuous operation) is emitted or\n2 tonnes CO2/‰. (This figure is derived from Dutch emission data and depends on the fuel\nmix).\nThe data in Table 3.2 are within the ranges of relative energy uses generally found when\ncomparing different cooling systems with similar cooling capacities. The data are not exact and\nshould not be used as such. Nor do they imply that one system is less preferred than the other.\nWhat the table clearly shows is that the effect due to loss of efficiency of cooling can be\nconsiderable and that the consequences for the total energy balance can be made comparable.\nThis table shows the importance of considering both the direct and indirect energy consumption\nwhen operating a cooling system.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable 3.2: Example of a comparison of yearly specific direct and indirect energy demand of different cooling systems and the consequences for CO2-emissions per MWth\n[tm059, Paping, 1995]\nSpecific direct energy consumption\n(kWe/MWth)\nIncreased T\npump (ºC)\nSpecific indirect\nenergy consumption\n(kWe/MWth)\nTotal energy\nconsumption\n(kWe/MWth)\nEinput per\nEdischarged\n(in ‰)\nCO2\n(tonnes/yr/MWth)\nCooling system\nPumps\nFans\nTotal\nApplied corr. factor1)\n=\n1.4 kWe/MWthºC\nTotal\ndirect+indirect\nOnce-through -direct\n10 (9-12)\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-indirect\n15 (12-18)\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen wet cooling tower\n15 (13-17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHybrid cooling\n15 (13-17)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClosed circuit cooling tower\n>15 (13-17)\n\n>23\n\n\n>34\n>85\n>170\nDry air cooling\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1)\nfor calculation of correction factor see Annex II\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n3.2.3 Reduction of required energy for cooling\nReduction of required energy use of cooling systems is a matter of environmental balance.\nAgain, integrated measures within the industrial process to reuse heat will decrease the need for\ndischarge of excess heat into the environment. If a smaller cooling capacity is required,\ngenerally and in absolute terms less energy is needed to operate the cooling system. More\nefficient equipment and proper operation of the cooling system avoiding temperature increase\non the process side can achieve any further reductions.\nThe right choice of material and design will reduce the required power consumption of cooling\nsystems. This is a very complex matter including many factors, where general advice is difficult\nto give. The following practices are applied and can be mentioned, as options one should be\naware of:\n1. proper lay-out of the cooling system, such as smooth surfaces and as few changes of flow\ndirection as possible, will avoid turbulence and reduce resistance to the flow of the coolant;\n2. in mechanical cooling towers, choice of type and position of fans and possibility of airflow\nadjustment are options for reduced energy use;\n3. choice of the right fill or packing (in light of the operating conditions) to secure maximum\nheat exchange at all times;\n4. choice of drift eliminators with minimum resistance to airflow.\nChanges in material and design do not seem to be cost-effective options to reduce energy\nrequirements for existing systems, particularly for large systems. Replacing cooling tower\ninternals (fans, fill and drift eliminators) are an option in some cases. For smaller systems, such\nas the open and closed recirculating wet cooling systems that are on the market as an off-the-peg\nproduct, a change of the cooling system is technically much easier.\nA good example of design effect is the application of smooth (finned) supporting pillars at the\ninlet of a large (178 m.) natural draught cooling tower for a nuclear power station. The design\nenhanced the airflow and reduced the pressure drop enabling 0.3ºC colder cooling, where 1ºC\ncooler for this installation is approximately equal to a saving of EUR 250000/year.\nVery little has been reported on the options for reducing the required amount of energy of a\ncooling tower through more energy efficient fans or by flexibility of operation system. In\nsupplier’s information, data can be found on the available fan types and the power needs. Fans\nare available that can be operated at variable speeds [tm97, Immell, 1996] or users are advised\nto apply a multifan system to have more flexibility in adjusting the required airflow.\nWith respect to the effect of drift eliminators on the performance of fans due to induced pressure\ndrop, [tm092, Becker and Burdick, 1994]. Concluded that there will be differences between\ndifferent eliminator designs and that the difference in effect on fan performance needs careful\nconsideration, taking the full systems context into account. This means that a complex\nevaluation must be carried out involving tower configuration and flow distribution across the\nfan and across the drift eliminator. From this a useful comparison between different fan designs\nwill be possible.\nExamples of changing cooling tower fill reported considerable increases in efficiency of the\nheat exchange, lowering the temperature of the cooling water leaving the tower and achieving a\nbetter cooling ([tm034, Hobson et al., 1995], [tm041, Burger, 1994], [tm117, Remberg and\nFehndrich, 1993].\nImproving the heat exchange capacity of the fill will improve the cooling of the process in the\nheat exchanger. Consequently, fan operation may be reduced whilst achieving the same level of\ncooling as before. With an unchanged level of operation, cooling capacity will be larger.\nApplying the wrong fill configuration can create unnecessary resistance to the air flowing past\nor through, but the tower geometry is also important. Dense film fill packs create larger air\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\npressure drops and usually require more fan energy. Splash fills have lower air side pressure\ndrop, but due to its lower efficiency this fill requires larger towers or more cells, and\ncompensation cannot be made with a higher energy input for fan operation.\nPractical experiences report a clear effect of maintenance in reducing the required amount of\nenergy to operate cooling systems. Generally, for water cooled systems this means proper\nsystems treatment to reduce the resistance in the system due to scaling, corrosion, fouling etc.\nSystems treatment will keep the surface of the exchangers, conduits and packs in cooling towers\nsmooth. It will prevent resistance to the water flow, reduce required pumping capacity and\nenhance the exchange of heat. Appropriate cooling water treatment (see Section 3.4), balancing\nthe application of cooling water additive against a rise in process temperature, will reduce direct\nenergy use as well as indirect energy use. No quantification of the reduction of kWe per MWth\ndischarged due to improved maintenance has been reported.\n3.3 Consumption and emission of cooling water\n3.3.1 Consumption of water\n3.3.1.1 Intake of water and water requirements\nWater is an important medium for cooling systems and especially for large once-through\nsystems, whereas for dry air-cooled systems it is of no importance. Surface water, groundwater\nand potable water are used. In principle salt water, brackish water and fresh water can be used\nfor cooling purposes. Salt water is abundantly available at coastal locations, but the\ndisadvantage of salt water is its corrosiveness. The use of groundwater for cooling purposes is\nexpected to reduce in the coming years, because groundwater for low-grade use (such as\ncooling) will be increasingly less permitted, unless it is combined with indispensable\ngroundwater extraction associated with other needs. Examples are the lowering of groundwater\nlevel for unhindered mine exploitation or water from pumping measures for hydropower. Less\ngroundwater availability could result in an increase in the consumption of surface water for\ncooling.\nWater use and water consumption are terms both used for the requirements of cooling water\nsystems. Water use means that the same volume of heated cooling water is directed back to the\nsource from which it has been taken (once-through). Water consumption mean that only part of\nthe water used for cooling (blowdown of recirculating systems) is directed back into receiving\nwater, the remainder having disappeared by evaporation and drift during the process of cooling.\nConsumption is particularly important where groundwater is used for cooling purposes in\ndrought sensitive areas.\nThe volume of water used is largely connected with the type of industry. Different sources show\nthat the use of cooling water in Europe is considerable [Correia, 1995]. Generally, the largest\nshare of (surface) water is required by power stations. The remainder in accounted for by a\nsmall number of larger industries, of which the chemical industry is the largest user.\nThe volume of water required varies between the various cooling water systems (Table 3.3). For\nonce-through systems (direct and indirect) the use of water depends on:\n• requirement of the process (condenser)\n• the temperature of intake water\n• the maximum allowed temperature increase of the receiving water\n• maximum allowed temperature of cooling water when it is discharged.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 3.3: Water requirement of the different cooling systems\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nCooling system\nAverage water use\n[m³/h/MWth]\nRelative water use\n[%]1\nOnce-through system –direct\n\n\nOnce-through system –indirect\n\n\nOpen wet cooling tower –direct\n\n2.3\nOpen wet cooling tower –indirect\n\n2.3\nOpen wet/dry (hybrid) cooling tower\n0.5\n0.6\nClosed circuit wet cooling tower\nvariable\nVariable\nClosed circuit dry air cooling tower\n\n\nClosed circuit wet/dry cooling tower\n1.5\n1.7\n1) assumption:\ncooling capacity ∆T 10 K\nopen wet cooling tower:\ncycles of concentration between 2 and 4\nopen wet/dry cooling:\n75% dry operation\nclosed circuit wet/dry tower dry operation ranging from 0 to 25 %\nIn open recirculating systems, closed circuit wet and closed circuit wet/dry cooling towers, most\nof the water is recycled and the heat is dispersed to the atmosphere mainly by evaporation. In\nthese systems water use varies considerably and no specific data are available as performance\ndepends on the concentration factor applied (regulated by the intentional blowdown),\nevaporation and to a lesser extent to the ambient temperature.\nIndirect closed circuit dry cooling towers can use water as secondary coolant but the use is very\nlow compared to that of water cooling systems. Normally, replenishment or make-up water is\nonly needed when leakage has occurred, e.g. at pump packages, flanges and valves, or when\nwater has been drained to allow systems repair. In those circumstances amounts are small and\npotable water or even demineralised water can be economically used.\nLegislation\nIn Member States different authorities deal with water as a resource or as a receiving\nenvironment. In any case water use should be part of an integrated environmental permit,\nespecially where supplies are limited. It is expected that throughout Europe the pressure on\nresources of good quality water will increase the pressure on water conservation measures in\ncooling systems, limiting volumes allowed to be extracted from a source. With respect to water\nuse the major legislation on European level is the Water Framework Directive. It focuses on\nboth the water quality and on the quantitative groundwater status defined in terms of the effect\nof the ground water level on associated surface ecosystems and in terms of sustainability of the\nwater supply. On a national level some Member States have separate legislation for aspects\nconcerning the intake and use of surface water.\nCross-media issues\nThe issue of restricting the use of water relates to the following environmental aspects:\n- \nheat emission to the surface water,\n- \napplication of cooling water additives,\n- \nenergy consumption of both cooling system and production process,\n- \nindirect emissions.\nEach of these factors needs to be assessed to evaluate whether reduced water intake for cooling\nis the best solution. In the following paragraphs an attempt is made to describe applied reduction\ntechniques options and their cross-media effects.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.3.1.2 Applied techniques to reduce water consumption\nReduction of water consumption for cooling is of particular interest where water availability is\nlow for natural or ecological reasons. This can be drought-stricken areas or areas with seasonal\nlow rainfall. The danger of depletion of groundwater sources and situations with relatively large\ncooling water requirements, where demands approach or could exceed the river flow or where\nheat emissions into the surface water are restricted, are other typical examples.\n1.\nCooling technology\nIn reducing the amount of water required for cooling, systems choice is important. In a\ngreenfield situation it is suggested that air cooling be considered e.g. by applying open cooling\ntowers. For large systems the required cooling capacity could limit the options for dry air\ncooling, as it requires a large heat exchange surface. If it is feasible, attention should be paid to\nthe change in overall efficiency, increased operation costs for fan operation and costs of noise\nabatement. Applications of dry cooling systems generally lead to a decrease of the process\nefficiency. Consequently, wet systems are to be preferred. Only in the case that no supply with\nwater (resp. make-up water) is possible dry cooling is unavoidable.\nFor existing once-through systems the application of recirculating systems (open wet cooling\ntowers) is an applied option to reduce water requirements. Towers are equipped with drift\neliminators as a standard technique to further reduce water loss through evaporation. Generally,\nrecirculation means that measures need to be taken to protect the heat-exchanging surface\nagainst scaling or corrosion. On the other hand, application of recirculation of cooling water at\nthe same time means a reduction of heat emission to the surface water.\n2.\nSystems operation\nIn recirculating wet cooling systems a commonly applied operation is the increase of the\nconcentration factor by reducing the frequency of the blowdown. The cleaner the water the\neasier this is and proper maintenance of an open wet cooling tower will reduce the\ncontamination of the cooling water and may enhance a higher number of cycles and\nconsequently a less frequent blowdown.\nIncreasing the cycles of concentration generally leads to an increased demand for anti-fouling\nchemicals to allow for higher salt concentrations without the risk of deposition. A number of\nreports can be found that present water treatment programs designed in particular for operation\nwith higher cycles of concentration to reduce water requirements and to reduce the volume of\nthe blowdown [tm094, Alfano and Sherren, 1995]. Under permit conditions, attention should be\ngiven to the potential increase in concentrations of elements in the blowdown.\nA critical review of the results of maximising cooling tower cycles and the problems\nencountered can be found in [tm095, Cunningham, 1995]. The conclusion is that the ability to\nincrease the number of cycles depends on many chemical and physical factors (e.g. water\ntemperature, pH, water velocity) and requires a high level of expertise. Given the variety of\noperating conditions and water chemistry, it may not be easy to predict the maximum cycles of\nconcentration and care must be taken to consider the costs involved before the cooling system\ncan be operated economically.\n3.\nAdditional techniques\nFor recirculating systems, using relatively limited amounts of water, a number of additional\ntechniques have been applied. These techniques aim at improving cooling water quality.\nPre-treatment of cooling water (such as flocculation, precipitation, filtration or membrane\ntechnology) can reduce the water requirements, where less blowdown is required to maintain the\nsame concentration factor. Water treatments however will lead to sludge that will have to be\ndisposed of (see Annex IV on blowdown).\nThe evaporative pond is a technique still applied on some older sites and is undergoing further\ndevelopment. It can be applied to prevent heat emissions to the surface water precooling the\ncooling water before discharge, but could serve in a similar way as a cooling tower being part of\nthe total circulation. In the evaporative pond water is cooled down by spraying it over a large\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\ncatchment area, creating large cooling surface, after which it can be reused (Annex XI).\nAttention should be paid to the microbiological risks due to the formation of aerosols (see\n3.7.3).\nReducing the demand on water resources is also attempted by linking the water flows of\ndifferent industrial units on one or more sites. This water conservation method can be quite\nsuccessful but needs careful consideration. In an evaluation of alternatives for water\nconservation for industrial sites, a number of important considerations are listed [tm065, Meier\nand Fulks, 1990] that should be taken into account:\n1. survey of available water resources and their chemistry;\n2. assessment of quantities of these sources and their fluctuation;\n3. assessment of the contaminants and treatments in water sources;\n4. the effect of current water resource treatment programmes on the existing cooling water\nconditioning methods;\n5. effect of potential conductivity increases of recycled water on the process where the water is\nused;\n6. chemical treatment programme options for the cooling systems;\n7. economics of alternative reuse methods.\nThe factors listed above affect the selection of water sources and the amount of water that can\nbe reused. Water resources on site are typically blowdowns from cooling towers and\nboilers.Tertiary treated municipal waste plant effluent is also used. It is important in all cases to\navoid an increased need for an even more complex water treatment programme to enable water\nreuse (Annex XI). Reuse of the blowdown of evaporative ponds is also possible in applications\nthat are not sensitive to the increased salt content of the water.\nThe zero discharge system based technology can be applied by treating and reusing the\nblowdown. Disposal costs of the resulting sludge need to be assessed against the environmental\ncosts of conditioning and discharging of blowdown (Annex XI).\n3.3.2 Fish entrainment\n3.3.2.1 Level of entrainment\nWhit a large water intake, such as for once-through cooling water systems, the impingement and\nentrainment of fish is an issue. Entrained fish - mainly fish larvae passing through the sieves at\nthe cooling water intake, the pumps and the condensers - are not generally sampled.\nEntrainment is a local matter and the quantity of entrained fish is based on a complex of\ntechnical and hydrobiological factors that lead to a site-specific solution. Water is drawn into\ninlet channels in large quantities and at considerable speed. The inlet channels are generally\nequipped with debris filters to protect the heat exchangers against clogging and mechanical\ndamage. Impingement occurs when fish are pressed against the sieves placed the condensers or\nheat exchangers. A lot of smaller creatures is taken in with the cooling water and is killed by\nmechanical damage, which is called entrainment.\nData on the amounts of fish taken in with the cooling water or caught at the entrance of a\ncooling system have not been widely reported. Results of 24-hour-samples have been analysed\non the number of fish impinged by the cooling water of a 600 MWe Netherlands power plant\n[KEMA, 1992] on the river Rhine, with a cooling waterflow of 22 – 25 m3/s. The results show\nthat the numbers of fish drawn in between years as well as between seasons of the same year\nvary widely. Most fish were found in summer.\nStudies at a 2000 MW inland power plant on the River Trent in England showed that by far the\nmajority of entrainment occurred at or soon after dusk, and in the summer. The power plant\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\ndoes not have a once-through cooling system, and no evidence was found of significant\nimpingement. This was also the case at another similar sized power plant on the River Thames\n[Carter and Reader, in press]. The screens at both plants have approximately 9 mm mesh width.\nResearch on entrained and impinged fish at nine Dutch power plants shows that more than 95%\nof the impinged fish were 0+-fish, born in the spring of the same year and with a length of less\nthan 10 cm. This is confirmed by results in the above-mentioned power plant on the River Trent,\nalthough mortality was 100% while there was negligible fish mortality compared with observed\nnatural death [Carter and Reader, in press].\nThere is also variation in the number of entrained fish and in entrained fish species between\ndifferent power plants. The results of a sampling programme at six Dutch power plants on the\nriver Rhine, the river Meuse and branches of these rivers show a variation in entrained species\nbetween 12 and 25 species and a variation in impinged fish on the cooling water sieves between\n0.02 and 2.45 fish per 1000 m3 cooling water averaged over the year [Hadderingh et al., 1983].\nAt power plants on lakes, on estuaries and on the sea coast the observed number of impinged\nfish can be much higher than at power plants on rivers, up to 25 fish per 1000 m3 [KEMA,\n1982].\nTable 3.4: Fish impingement rates (FIR) at power stations.

The optimum solutions and results\nand the ability to meet BAT requirements are influenced by a wide variety of biological,\nenvironmental and engineering factors that must be evaluated on a site-specific basis. A\ncomparison of the different techniques is therefore impossible.\n1.\nCooling technology\nTechnology changes made to avoid fish entrainment have not been reported. It is obvious that\nfish entrainment will not be an issue when changing to open or closed recirculating cooling\nsystems, which is a costly operation. It may be considered in a greenfield situation. Devices to\nprevent intake of fish can be found in e.g. power industry and refineries. Solutions for\nprevention are:\n- \nsound devices, positive to divert (a shoal of) scale fish but not for eel;\n- \nlight systems with underwater lamps, positive to divert eel;\n- \nposition, depth and design of the inlet;\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n- \nlimits to speed of the water inflow (although the data from studies carried out in England\nindicate that the entrained fish allow themselves to be carried by the flow (i.e. deliberately\ndrifting or dispersing) even when they are physically capable of escaping the flow by\nswimming);\n- \nmesh size of the cooling water sieves (against damage to the cooling system). Observations\nhave shown that, in the same power plant, a mesh size of 5 x 5 mm on average doubles the\nnumber of surviving entrained fish at the cooling water outlet compared with a mesh size of\n2 x 2 mm, because impingement mortality of fish larvea is higher than entrainment\nmortality [KEMA, 1972] and [Hadderigh, 1978].\nMortality of impinged fish can be decreased by a good system to wash the fish from the cooling\nwater sieves and to sluice them back to the surface water.\n2.\nOperating practice and end-of-pipe techniques\nLowering the inflow velocity to below 0.1-0.3 m/s clearly showed a positive effect and reduced\nthe amount of fish drawn in. However, lowering the velocity may mean that larger inlet\nchannels are required, which may have technical and financial consequences. In general,\nchanges in operating practice or the application end-of-pipe techniques do not apply to fish\nentrainment, but there is also a view –not shared by all- that entrainment could be reduced by\ntaking account of the diurnal and seasonal patterns of entrainment.\nTable 3.5: Available fish protection technologies for cooling water intake devices\nDerived from [tm152, Taft, 1999]\nCategory\nProtection technique\nEffects\nRemarks\nOptimizing (increasing) the\nmesh-size of the travelling\nwater screens\nImprove survival of\nentrained fish larvae and\nvery young fish stadia\nEntrainment mortality of\nthese fish stadia is lower\nthan the impingement\nmortality of these stadia.\nLow pressure water jets to\nwash off the fish from the\ntravelling screens and to\nreturn them to the surface\nwater\nTransport of fish back to\nthe surface water\nRequires a second high\npressure jet system to clean\nthe travelling screens\nFish buckets on the screens\nImprove survival of\nimpinged fish\nThe fish remain in water\npermanently during\ntransport back to the\nsurface water\nContinuous rotation of the\ntravelling screens\nImprove survival of\nimpinged fish\nReduction of impingement\ntime\nFish collection\nsystems\nFish pumps\nTransport of fish back to\nthe surface water\nComplicated to keep right\nconditions in pipes\nFish diversion\nsystems\nAngled screens or louvres\nwith a fish by-pass\n- \nSurvival harder\nspecies (50-100%) >\nfragile species\n- \nNot for fish eggs,\nlarvae and small\ninvertebrates\n- \nRequires uniform,\nconstant low-velocity\nflow\n- \nDebris must be\nremoved\nLights\n- \nstrobe lights\n- \ncontinuous lights\n- \nmercury lights\n- \nother lights\nEffects of different light\nsystems depend on local\nsituation, fish species and\ndevelopmental stadia of the\nfish.\nIn many situations a by-\npass for diverted fish is\nnecessary\nBehavioural\nbarriers\nSound\nEffects depend on local\nsituation, fish species and\ndevelopmental stadia of the\nfish.\nIn many situations a by-\npass for diverted fish is\nnecessary\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.3.2.3 Costs of sound devices and light systems\nIt is obvious that any change made to an existing system will be costly. The power industry\nreported additional costs for fish protection technology applied to existing installations of\nbetween EUR 40000 and 200000, including downtime costs. In greenfield situations the\nadditional investment of alternative intake devices would probably be less substantial.\nFor a good efficacy the water current through sound devices and light systems must not be\nhigher than 0.3 – 0.5 m/s. This determines the length of the systems.\nThe material and construction costs of a light system are EUR 90000 – 140000 for a length of\n100 m and of a sound system (BAFF) about EUR 180000 per 100 m.\n3.3.3 Heat emission to surface water\n3.3.3.1 Levels of heat emission\nAll heat that is discharged will finally end up in the air. If water is used as the intermediate\ncooling medium, all heat will be transferred to the air, either from the water droplets in a\ncooling tower or from the surface of the receiving water. Before the heat has left the surface\nwater it may affect the aquatic ecosystem and this should be avoided.\nHeat emission is also an issue closely related to the amount of cooling water used and\ndischarged. Once-through systems, both direct and indirect, by definition form the largest\nsource of heat discharged to the surface water, as the heat is entirely discharged via the cooling\nwater. The cooling water in recirculating systems releases the majority of its heat via a cooling\ntower into the air. The amount of heat discharged with the drainage from a cooling tower\namounts to approximately 1.5% of the heat to be discharged, whereas around 98.5% is released\ninto the air. There is little information on the effects on the aquatic ecosystem of heat emissions,\nbut there are experiences with high summer temperatures and small receiving waterways.\nTemperature rise may lead to increased rates of respiration and of biological production\n(eutrophication). The discharge of cooling water into the surface water influences the total\naquatic environment, especially fish. The temperature has a direct effect on all life forms and\ntheir physiology and an indirect effect by affecting the oxygen balance.\nWarming reduces the saturation value of oxygen; with high oxygen concentration, that leads to\na reduced oxygen level. Warming also accelerates the microbial degradation of organic\nsubstances, causing increased oxygen consumption. Also, where circulation of the cooling water\noccurs or where a number of industries use the same limited source of surface water, heat\nemissions need careful consideration to prevent interference with the operation of industrial\nprocesses downstream.\nFrom the specific heat of water amounting to approximately 4.2 kJ/kg/K the temperature rise of\nwater can be calculated. For example, when cooling water is warmed up by an average of 10K,\n1 MWth of heat requires a cooling water flow of about 86 m³/hour. Broadly speaking each kWth\nneeds 0.1 m³/hour of cooling water. With recirculating cooling water, heat is transferred to the\nair through evaporation via cooling water in a cooling tower with the evaporation heat of water\nbeing 2500 kJ/kg (at 20ºC).\nIn the power industry in particular, the factors playing a role in the discharge of large quantities\nof heat into the surface water have been researched. A number of physical phenomena have to\nbe taken into account when heat emissions are being assessed, such as:\n• \nseasonal variation in the temperature of the receiving water;\n• \nseasonal variation in the water level of rivers and the variation in the velocity of the stream;\n• \nthe extent of mixing of the discharged cooling water with the receiving water (near field and\nfar field);\n• \nat coastal sites, tidal movements or strong currents and\n• \nconvection in the water and to the air.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe behaviour of the hot water plume in the surface water will not only be valuable in\nprotecting the receiving environment, but also for choosing the right place for the inlet and\noutlet. It will always be important to prevent circulation of the plume affecting the temperature\nof the water taken in and consequently the efficiency of the cooling system. As an example, the\nextent of a thermal plume, defined as the area within the 1K heating isotherm, without mixing\nwith strong currents (e.g in a lake), is about 1 ha per MWe for a conventional power plant, or\nabout 45 km2 for a 5000 MWe power plant. For a more extensive description on heat plume\nbehaviour see Annex XII.\n3.3.3.2 Legislative requirements of heat emissions\nRequirements for specific fresh water bodies\nEuropean Directive 78/659/EEC (18 July 1978) sets environmental quality standards for certain\nsubstances and for heat discharges in designated freshwater fisheries. The directive\nacknowledges local conditions in a provision in Article 11 regarding derogation for Member\nStates.\nWhere thermal requirements depend on the fish species, two types of water bodies are\ndistinguished, according to their fish population:\n- \nsalmonid waters\n- \ncyprinid waters.\nFor each ecological system, three thermal parameters are applied:\n- \nmaximum water temperature at the boundary of the mixing zone\n- \nmaximum temperature during the breeding period of “cold water species”\n- \nmaximum temperature rise.\nTable 3.6: Thermal requirements of water temperatures for two ecological systems (European\nDirective 78/659/EEC)\nParameter\nSalmonid waters\nCyprinid waters\nTmax at boundary of mixing zone (ºC)\n21.5\n28.0\nTmax during breeding period cold water\nspecies (ºC)\n10.0\n10.0\n∆Tmax (ºC) at boundary of mixing zone\n1.5\n3.0\nNote: temperature limits may be exceeded for 2% of the time at maximum.\nOther receiving water bodies\nIn the Member States, heat emission to the surface water is regulated in various ways,\ndepending on the ecological conditions and other factors such as: the sensitivity of the receiving\nsurface water; the local climatic conditions; the capacity of the receiver to accommodate\nthermal loads and the prevailing currents and waves (water hydrodynamics). Regulations often\nconsider heat emissions in relation to the receiving surface water. Examples are:\n• \nstandardisation of the maximum discharge temperature (e.g 30ºC in summer in temperate\nclimates and 35ºC in hot countries),\n• \nlimiting maximum heating in relation to the water received and to seasonal temperature\ndifferences (e.g. ∆Tmax of 7-10K measured over the entire cooling water distance in the\nproduction process)\n• \nsetting maximum acceptable temperature profile of the surface water and the total available\ncooling capacity of the surface water.\nThese requirements are formulated in permits.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nOther regulations do not prescribe a generally fixed discharge temperature. Initially the limit\ndischarge temperature corresponds with the type of cooling system. Additionally, seasonal\nvariation of the temperature of the surface water plays an important role in setting the discharge\ntemperature to be permitted. Some regional authorities also further classify the receiving waters\nusing characteristics of their fauna.\n3.3.3.3 Applied reduction techniques\n1.\nCooling technology\nThe best way to minimise heat emissions is to reduce the need for discharge by optimising the\nprimary process or to find consumers for the excess heat. In the case of emission of heat into the\nenvironment, focus is on the problem of heat emissions into surface waters. In considering the\nreduction techniques it is important to realise that in the end all heat will disappear to the air and\nthat the surface water is an intermediate medium. By choosing between different cooling\nsystems, it can be decided which is preferable. Thus, the environmental impact of heat discharge\ncan be minimised by discharging more heat into the atmosphere and less heat into surface\nwaters at the expense of water loss due to evaporation. Minimisation of heat discharges to the\nsurface water is linked to the minimisation of water use and to the overall energy efficiency.\nThe more heat is discharged by convection and evaporation, the more E per discharged MWth is\nrequired due to use of fans, unless natural draught is applied. This generally needs large\ninvestments and a lot of space.\nIn the case of large capacities, a widely practised solution to reduce the heat load to the surface\nwater of (mainly) rivers and lakes is to choose a suitable heat transfer technology, e.g. instead of\na once-through system a recirculating system with an open wet or wet/dry cooling tower.\n2.\nOperating practice\nNo particular operational options have been reported to prevent or reduce the discharge of heat\nto the surface water.\n3.\nAdditional techniques\nAn old practice still in use in Europe, but on a very small scale and recently attracting fresh\nattention, is the use of evaporative (spray) ponds. To enhance cooling of the water, the angle of\nthe nozzle and the time allowed for the water to remain in the pond before it re-enters the\ncooling circuit are important, as is sufficient surface area. To assess this technique it should be\ncompared with a cooling tower of similar capacity. Attention should be paid to:\n• \nsurface area needed,\n• \nloss of water due to evaporation\n• \nenergy use\n• \nthe need for water treatment, as well as\n• \nto microbiological risks due to formation of aerosols (see also 3.7.3).\nAnother kind of end-of-pipe technique is the precooling of the discharge of large power plants\nby means of a cooling tower. It is a costly technique used where circulation of the discharge in\nthe surface water can influence the cooling water temperature at the point of inlet. The\nadditional costs of the extra cooling tower plus the loss of water due to evaporation will have to\nbe compared with the costs related to a reduced efficiency with a higher temperature of the\nintake water.\nA measure also suggested to reduce the effect of heat discharge is designing the water outlet of\nthe cooling system in such a way that by turbulence the water will lose some heat during\ndischarge. A side effect of this measure is an increase of the oxygen content of the cooling water\ncompensating for the loss of oxygen due to the higher cooling water temperatures. No data are\navailable and the extent of the effect is also questioned.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n3.4 Emissions from cooling water treatment\nEmissions from cooling water treatment into the surface water are regarded as one of the most\nimportant cooling systems issues. Four sources of emissions to the surface water resulting from\nwet cooling systems can be distinguished:\n• \nprocess chemicals (product) and their reactants, due to leakage;\n• \ncorrosion products due to corrosion of the cooling system equipment;\n• \napplied cooling water additives and their reactants;\n• \nairborne substances.\nTo control these emissions different techniques are applied. The risk of leakage can be reduced\nas well as the possibility of uncontrolled emissions after leakage and the most adequate material\nfor the equipment can be selected to reduce corrosion. This section will focus on measures to\nreduce the amount and the impact of emissions due to the application of cooling water additives:\n• \nby reducing the need for water treatment;\n• \nby selecting chemical treatments which have lower impact on the environment;\n• \nby applying the chemicals in the most effective way (systems operation).\n3.4.1 Application of cooling water treatment\nCooling water is treated to promote an efficient transfer of heat and to protect the cooling\nsystem so as to overcome a number of adverse effects on the performance of the cooling\nequipment. In other words, cooling water treatment aims to reduce total energy consumption.\nThe adverse effects are strongly related to the chemistry of the water taken in for cooling and\nthe way the cooling system is operated (e.g. cycles of concentration). Salt water will have\ndifferent demands from fresh water and industrial emissions of polluted substances upstream\nmay be a challenge. Also, cooling water can become contaminated by leakage of process fluids\nfrom heat exchangers or, in the case of wet open cooling towers, by the air passing through the\ntower introducing dust, micro-organisms and exchange of vapour.\nCooling water additives are used for once-through systems, open wet cooling systems, closed\ncircuit wet cooling and wet/dry systems. Where water is used as an intermediate coolant in the\ncoil of dry systems, very low amounts of additives may be used to condition the water in the\nclosed loop.\nEnvironmentally, additives are important: they leave the cooling system at some stage, being\ndischarged to surface water or, to a much lesser extent, into air. Generally, the chemistry and the\napplication of the chemicals applied are known, but the choice of non-oxidizing biocides is\nmainly based on “trial and error”. The environmental effects of the chemicals used can be\nassessed by means of modelling (risk/hazard) or by measurement. As they are used to improve\nan efficient heat exchange, their application is also related to the adverse effects that arise from\na lower exchange efficiency. The industrial process to be cooled can be affected when heat\ntransfer is inefficient, causing an increase in the use of energy (i.e. similar to an increase in air\nemissions) or a higher demand on raw materials to compensate for the loss of production.\nEnergy consumption of the cooling system can increase due to a higher demand on pumps and\nfans to compensate for loss of heat exchange efficiency.\nProblems arising from water quality that are commonly encountered are:\n• \nCorrosion of cooling water equipment, which may lead to leakage of heat exchangers and\nspills of process fluids into the environment or loss of vacuum in condensers;\n• \nScaling, predominantly by precipitation of calcium carbonates, sulphates and phosphates,\nZn and Mg;\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n• \n(Bio-)Fouling of conduits and heat exchangers (also fill of wet cooling towers) by micro-,\nmacro-organisms and suspended solids which can lead to blockage of the heat exchanger\ntubes by large particulate (shells) or to emissions to air from cooling towers.\nC orrosion\nD eposition\n(Fouling)\nB io-film\nScale\nFigure 3.1: Graphic representation of interrelation between the different water quality problems\nCooling water problems are often interrelated. Scaling can lead to both corrosion and\nbiofouling. Spots of corrosion lead to changed waterflow patterns and create turbulence areas,\nwhere biofouling is enhanced. Biofouling may enhance further corrosion of the underlying\nsurface (Figure 3.1).\nThe following groups of chemicals are used to condition the water (see also Annex V):\n• \nCorrosion inhibitors:\nformerly metals were mainly used, but there is a trend towards azoles, phosphonates,\npolyphosphates and polymers. This means that toxicity decreases while the persistency\nincreases. Recently some better biodegradable polymers have been developed.\n• \nhardness stabilisers or scale inhibitors:\nformulas exist mainly of polyphosphates, phosphonates and certain polymers. Recent\ndevelopments in this application are also towards better biodegradable compounds\n• \nDispersion chemicals:\nmostly copolymers, often in combination with surfactants. The main environmental effect is\npoor biodegradability.\n• \nOxidising biocides:\nchlorine (or a combination of chlorine and bromine) and monochloramine are mainly used.\nChlorine (bromine) is a strong oxidiser (acutely toxic), which means that the half-life is\nshort, but the side effects of chlorinating are the forming of halogenated by-products. Other\noxidising biocides are ozone, UV, hydrogen peroxide or peracetic acid. The use of ozone\nand UV needs pre-treatment of the make-up water and needs special materials. The\nenvironmental effects are expected to be less harmful then halogenated biocides, but the\napplication needs special care, is expensive and not applicable in all situations.\n• \nNon-oxidising biocides:\nisothiazolones, DBNPA, glutaraldehyde and quaternary ammonium compounds etc. These\ncompounds are in general acutely toxic and often not readily biodegradable, although there\nare some which hydrolyse or are degraded by other mechanisms. The environmental effects\nare significant.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 3.7: Chemical components of cooling water treatments used in open and recirculating wet\ncooling systems\nDerived from [tm135, Nalco, 1988]\nWater quality problems\nCorrosion\nScaling\n(Bio-)fouling\nExamples of\nchemical treatment*\nOnce-\nthrough\nsystems\nRecircu-\nlating\nsystems\nOnce-\nthrough\nsystems\nRecircu-\nlating\nsystems\nOnce-\nthrough\nsystems\nRecircu-\nlating\nsystems\nZinc\nX\nMolybdates\nX\nSilicates\nX\nPhosphonates\nX\nX\nPolyphosphates\nX\nX\nPolyol esters\nX\nNatural organics\nX\nPolymers\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nNon-oxidizing\nbiocides\nX\nOxidyzing biocides\nX\nX\nNotes:\nchromate is not widely used any more due its high environmental effect\nThe need for cooling water treatment and type and amount of chemicals applied are more\nextensively described in Annex V. The application of cooling water conditioning is a highly\ncomplex and local issue, where selection is based on a combination of the following elements:\n- \ndesign and material of heat exchanger equipment;\n- \ntemperature and chemistry of the cooling water;\n- \norganisms in the surface water that can be entrained;\n- \nsensitivity of the receiving aquatic ecosystem to emitted additive and its associated by-\nproducts.\nFor proper performance of any of the treatments, control of the cooling water pH and alkalinity\nwithin a specified range is usually required. Good pH and alkalinity control has become more\nimportant where more pH-sensitive treatment programmes are used or where higher cycles of\nconcentration are applied in open recirculating cooling towers to minimise blowdown and\nreduce the water requirement. It is increasingly common practice in industry to have\nmaintenance programmes developed and carried out by the additive supplier, but the\nresponsibility for systems operation remains with the owner of the cooling system.\nConsidering the site and system specificity, it will be difficult to find typical levels of amounts\nof additives applied to the different systems. If levels are reported they are expressed in kg or\ntonnes per m3 of cooling water or in kg or tonnes per MWth dissipated. Table 3.8 reports the\nresult of a recent inventory in The Netherlands of chlorine, which is widely used in Dutch\nindustry. Data show there is variation between systems as well as between different types of\nwater. Other sources of water used by recirculating systems are for instance potable water,\ngroundwater and condensate.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable 3.8: Consumption of hypochlorite in wet cooling systems in The Netherlands\n[tm160, Bijstra, 1999]\nConsumption of active chlorine kg/MWth/yr\nCooling water source\nOnce-through systems\nRecirculating systems\nFresh water\n85 (10-155)\nSalt or brackish water\n400 (25-2500)\n200 (20-850)\nOther water sources\n400 (20-1825)\n3.4.2 Emissions of chemicals into the surface water\nIn Europe and U.S. a large amount of work has been carried out on optimisation of cooling\nwater conditioning, on the application of alternative treatments and on other techniques to\nprevent any harmful effects on the aquatic environment due to cooling water additives. By large,\nthis work focuses on the application of biocides.\nSpecific emissions resulting from cooling water treatment can be difficult to assess in situations\nwhere analysis methods for the chemicals used for treatment are not available. Besides the\nspecific chemicals used for treatment of cooling water, by-products originating from the\nchemicals used can also contribute significantly to the environmental impact on the surface\nwater. When chlorine or bromine is used as an additive, 3-5% of the product reacts to haloform\ncompounds (chloroform or bromoform) [tm072, Berbee, 1997].\nQuantification of short-term effects can be achieved by carrying out (acute) toxicity tests on\ncooling water streams discharged. These results can be seen as a minimum estimate of the\nenvironmental effects in the surface water, [because long term (chronic) effects,\nbiodegradability, bioaccumulation (Pow) and carcinogenic effects are not included in these tests].\nRecently several studies concerning the use of oxidising biocides (mainly hypochlorite)\n([tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997],[tm072, Berbee, 1997] and [tm160, Bijstra, 1999]) and non-\noxidizing biocides ([tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997] and [tm149, Baltus et al., 1999]) have been\ncarried out in the Netherlands.\n3.4.2.1 Oxidising biocides\nIn several countries programmes have been set up to achieve optimum use of hypochlorite in\ncooling water. Free oxidant [mg FO/l] is often used as a control parameter in cooling water. In\nThe Netherlands a concentration of 0.1 – 0.2 [mg FO/l] in the discharge is used as a target\nconcentration for continuous dosed (once-through) cooling systems. For intermittent or shock\nchlorination regimes the FO or FRO concentration is always below 0.2 mg/l as a daily (24h)\naverage value. But during shock injection the FO or FRO concentrations can be close or equal\nto 0.5 mg/l (hourly avarage).\nOptimisation by implementation of monitoring and controlled (automatic) dosage of biocides\ncan significantly reduce the annual consumption of chemicals used in cooling water. This can\nresult in a reduction of the load of biocides and of their by-products, such as organohalogenated\ncompounds with bromoform as the main product [tm157, Jenner et al, 1998].\nSeveral companies in the chemical industry and energy production sector have achieved\nreductions of the use of hypochlorite in cooling water up to 50 % by introducing the above-\nmentioned optimisation measures [tm160, Bijstra, 1999].\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n3.4.2.2 Non-oxidising biocides\nIn 1999 a study was carried out of the environmental effects of the use of oxidising and non-\noxidising chemicals in recirculating cooling systems. For the chemicals for which analysis\nmethods were available, concentrations of the chemicals in cooling water were measured. For\nall chemicals applied, toxicity tests were used to evaluate the environmental impact in the\nsurface water. When cooling water is discharged directly into the surface water the use of non\noxidising chemicals in recirculating cooling systems in many cases resulted in strong\nenvironmental effects in the surface water. For oxidising chemicals (hypochlorite), PEC/PNEC\nratios based on toxicity tests were found in the range of 3 (continuous dosage) and 33 (shock\ndosage) and for non-oxidising chemicals, PEC/PNEC ratios of 20 (isothiazolines), 2500 (BNS),\n660-13000 (BNS/MBT) and 3700(DBNPA) were found ([tm149, Baltus et al., 1999] see pag\nsummary pag. 9-10, table 16 p. 64 and chapter 9 p. 75-82)).\nAnother study carried out indicated that potential risks for the receiving surface water cannot be\nexcluded when isothiazolines (1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-on, 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-on) are used\nin cooling water as additives (see[tm149, Baltus et al., 1999] pag. 13 en 14).\nThe treatment programmes vary considerably and depend on the factors mentioned earlier and\nas such are site-specific. Emissions of additives vary in volume and chemistry (toxicity,\nreactivity). Decomposition, interaction and possible purification measures can influence the\nactual amount that is finally discharged and, consequently, the resulting impact on the aquatic\nenvironment. Optimisation and controlled conditioning of cooling water by the use of\n(automatic) dosage and monitoring can reduce the use of chemicals in cooling water and\nconsequently the environmental impact in the receiving water significantly.\nIn the Netherlands the application of hypochlorite and bromine in cooling water is one of the\nmost important sources of organohalogenated compounds, measured as AOX, in surface water\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997] and [tm072, Berbee, 1997].\nSometimes cooling water is treated in a wastewater treatment installation before discharge. An\nexample is the treatment of the blowdown with other wastewater streams in refineries. This\ntreatment could possibly reduce the effect of biocides in the surface water. Biological treatment\nmay be sensitive to low levels of non-oxidising biocides, which could disturb the working of the\ntreatment plant. Inhibition of active sludge of 60% and more (100%) has been reported.\nPhysical/chemical treatment for biocides is still on an experimental level. The polarity of non-\noxidative biocides will be an obstacle for physical treatment, as they will remain in the water\nphase.\nThe blowdown of open recirculating systems is the more controlled pathway in which biocides\nenter the external environment. For closed systems blowdown is not practised. Purges are made,\nbut they are small and usually discharged into a sewer system. It is obvious that the\nconcentration of biocides in the cooling water immediately after dosage will be highest and\nconsequently the concentration in the discharge or purge. By chemical reactions in the systems’\ncooling water, such as hydrolysis, the biocide concentration will gradually diminish and this\nknowledge can be used to estimate the expected concentration in the discharge. This\ninformation is also used when closing the purge after treatment to prevent discharge of biocides\nwith a high level of chemical activity. To achieve further optimisation several factors are\nimportant. Besides the concentration in the outlet, process control is also essential here.\n3.4.2.3 Factors influencing emissions of biocides\nFactors influencing discharge and persistence in the receiving aquatic environment have been\nextensively described [tm004, Baltus and Berbee, 1996] for a number of commonly applied\noxidising and non-oxidising biocides. The following factors, in combination with the cooling\nprocess conditions play a role in the selection of a cooling water treatment program:\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n• \nHydraulic half-time (also used is system half-life);\n• \nHydrolysis;\n• \nBiodegradation;\n• \nPhotolyses;\n• \nVolatility.\nThe volume of the purge determines the hydraulic half time. The larger the purge the smaller the\nhydraulic half time and the shorter the retention time of the biocide. The hydraulic half time\ndoes not influence the working of oxidising biocides, because of their fast dissociation and\nworking, but for non-oxidising biocides it will limit their functioning.\nHydrolysis of a non-oxidising biocide occurs at a certain pH and water-temperature. Generally,\nwith increasing pH and/or increasing temperature, hydrolysis increases and the biocidal effect\nwill decrease. Consequently, the lower temperature of the receiving water will further slow\ndown the hydrolysis and will increase the persistence of non-oxidising biocides in the aquatic\nenvironment.\nBiodegradation, photolysis and volatility do not play an important role in degradation of non-\noxidising biocides. Photolysis can take place if the aquatic environment is exposed to sunlight.\nEvaporation may play a role in the case of oxidising biocides (hypochlorite). Research can be\nquoted in which a so called stripping effect of cooling towers has been found to account for a\nloss of 10-15% of hypochlorite with each passage of the cooling tower. For hypochlorite the pH\nlevel affects its evaporation.\nBiodegradation of biocides depends on the amount of organic and inorganic matter and on the\nbiodegradability of the biocide itself. A large microbial population, increase of temperature and\nhigher oxygen content of the cooling water or the receiving water, increases biodegradation.\nSurface water contains a lot of suspended organic matter to which biocides can absorb, resulting\nin accumulation in the sediment. Also, biocides can be reduced by organic material.\n3.4.2.4 Emission levels\nIt is difficult to report representative levels of concentrations in cooling water emissions to the\nsurface water. Quantification of emissions of substances in the discharge of cooling water has\nbeen attempted and models have been developed. However, because of site specificity, no\ngenerally applicable model can be reported taking account all aspects. Many assumptions have\nto be made and although they give an indication, discharges could easily be overestimated or\nunderestimated. An example of a model for biocides in an open wet cooling tower is explained\n[tm004, Baltus and Berbee, 1996] in Annex IX.\n3.4.2.5 Legislation\nIn many Member States emissions of cooling water chemicals are covered by legislation on the\npollution of surface waters. The laws usually focus on discharge flows with a minimum volume\ndischarged (in m3/day). In some legislation (e.g. Italy) receiving waters are classified and each\nwater has a different level for the relevant emission parameters of the discharged water.\nThe quality of the discharged water required sets limits on the presence of certain chemicals\n(e.g. chromium, zinc or mercury compounds), thereby reducing the use of particular cooling\nwater additives.\nFor large and small discharge volumes, requirements are set for temperature and pH-values. The\ntemperature is generally not allowed to exceed a maximum temperature for most of the year.\nSome flexibility is given by varying the discharge temperature limits under unfavourable\nseasonal conditions, such as wet bulb temperatures reaching up to 40°C in Mediterranean\nclimate.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nMore specific requirements on the chemical composition vary between the Member States, but\ngenerally cover requirements on the concentration of adsorbable organic halogens (AOX),\ndissolved oxygen, biological chemical demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD),\nchlorine substances and phosphorus compounds and the residual effect on luminescent bacteria.\nSome acts distinguish between different types of cooling systems (once-through or\nrecirculating) or consider specific operations, such as shock treatment with microbiocidal\nsubstances.\nIn the Netherlands the abatement efforts are based on the intrinsic properties of substances and\nrisk assessments. To enable a company and the water authorities to unambiguously identify the\nwater pollution effect of substances and preparations, a general evaluation methodology has\nbeen developed. This evaluation methodology is based on the European legislation on\nclassification, packaging and labelling.\nDepending on the properties of a substance BTM or BPM must be applied. After applying\nBTM/BPM the residual discharge is evaluated against the applicable water quality objectives. If\nthese objectives are not reached, further measures may be indicated.\nEuropean chemical legislation affecting the application of cooling water additives in particular\ncan be found in:\n• \nthe Council Directive on Pollution Caused by Certain Dangerous Substances Discharged\ninto the Aquatic Environment of the Community (76/464/EEC),\n• \nthe Water Framework Directive,\n• \nthe Preparations Directive and\n• \nthe Biocidal Products Directive 98/8.\n3.4.3 Reduction of emissions to the surface water\n3.4.3.1 General approach\nTechniques for the reduction of emissions to surface water due to the application of cooling\nwater are:\n1. reduction of corrosion of cooling equipment\n2. reduction of leakage of process substances into the cooling circuit\n3. application of alternative cooling water treatment\n4. selection of less hazardous cooling water additives\n5. optimised application of cooling water additives\nFollowing IPPC, reduction of emissions due to cooling water treatment should aim at reducing\nthe need for treatment (prevention) and at selection and optimal application of additives\n(pollution control) within the requirement of maximum heat exchange. To reduce the emission\nof chemicals in the discharge of cooling water, many options are available. In addition to the\nassessment of the appropriate cooling configuration explained in Chapter 1 and in accordance\nwith the preventive “approach” of applying BAT to industrial cooling systems, the reduction\noptions can be considered in a certain order. For new large capacity cooling systems, an\n“approach” has been developed to reduce emissions to the surface water [tm001, Bloemkolk,\n1997].\nAn “approach” has been developed for the selection of biocides in both new and existing\nsystems. [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996] . Both “approaches” involve more or less the\nsame steps and following these steps will ensure that all important factors involved in the\nreduction of additive use are taken into account. The “approaches” are shown in Figure 3.2 and\nFigure 3.3.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFor the optimisation of biocide use a wide range of possibilities exist, which are often\ninterrelated. For setting up an optimisation scheme, a structured “approach” offers advantages\nRecommendations are now presented by means of two flow charts, one for cooling water\nsystems in the design phase and another for existing CWS. These charts offer a step-by-step\n“approach” for biocide optimisation.\nFigure 3.2 is explained as follows [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996] . In the design phase of\na cooling water system, a decision should be made on the type of cooling that is to be used. If\nwater-cooling is used, engineering solutions that control the expected biofouling population in\nthe CWS should be considered. Important issues to consider in the design phase are:\nmaintenance of sufficiently high flow velocities in all parts of the cooling water system and a\nsmooth design of conduits and heat exchangers. This will reduce settlement of biofouling\norganisms. The application of non-toxic foul-release coatings will help to further reduce the\nsettlement of organisms. The intake structure should be designed such that entrainment of debris\nand organisms is minimised. Filtering devices and trash racks can further reduce the amount of\nentrained gross matter. The application of high integrity materials needs to be considered. For\nheat exchangers this can be titanium (corrosion resistant, smooth surface). Hydrodynamically\ndesigned inlet and outlet boxes of heat exchangers can be made out of glass reinforced plastics.\nThis material can also be applied for tubing and joints in the system. Also, relatively simple\nprovisions can be made in the design phase, such as connections for chemical and biological\nmonitoring devices, or for dosing (e.g. special dosing racks and points) or more complex ones\nfor mechanical cleaning, such as mussel sieves or a sponge rubber ball system. In some cases\nheat treatment can be used to control macrofouling, and then no biocide is needed at all. For the\napplication of heat treatment a special loop in the CWS needs to be designed. Further\npossibilities for optimisation are similar to those in existing systems.\nFigure 3.2: Design scheme for cooling water systems aiming at reduction of biocide application\n[tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996]\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nFigure 3.3: “approach” for reduction of biocide use in industrial cooling water systems\n[tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996]\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFigure 3.3 shows all the steps to be consider in the selection of biocides [tm005, Van Donk and\nJenner, 1996] . In an existing CWS it is important to characterise the biofouling population and\nthe size of the biofouling risk. Adequate biological monitoring is a prerequisite for this.\nThe cause of the biofouling problem should be analysed and addressed. The quality of the\ncooling water can be improved by pre-treatment of the water (e.g. micro- and macro-filtration).\nThis can remove a part of the biofouling risk by reducing the amount of incoming organisms\nand nutrients. If process leakages are the main cause of increased biological growth, they should\nbe eliminated, for instance by application of corrosion resistant materials or by installation of\nspare heat exchangers, which allows more frequent mechanical cleaning. In order to improve\nsystem conditions, all options mentioned in scheme 1 should be considered.\nIn once-through systems, macrofouling is sometimes controlled by the application of heat\ntreatment, without any biocide use. Sodium hypochlorite is the most important biocide that is\napplied. Dosing is shock-wise or continuous. The dosing strategy on macrofouling control\nshould be preventive, since curative dosing, when a lot of macrofouling has abundantly\ndeveloped, requires very high doses over extended periods. It is recommended that\nconsideration be given to the option of targeted dosage at locations with a high fouling risk,\nsuch as heat exchanger inlet and outlet boxes. Chemical monitoring is essential to establish the\nminimum required biocide dose. Since the applied oxidising biocide concentration will decrease\nin the CWS, chemical monitors are needed to register the effective residual level of biocide at\nthe critical points in the CWS. On-line meters should be hand-calibrated with the colorimetric\nDPD test on a regular basis. Toxicity-based measurement of biocide concentrations in the\ncooling water is also useful for optimisation schemes. Macrofouling monitoring devices give\ninformation on the settlement and growth of macrofouling organisms and on the performance of\nthe biofouling control program. This information is essential for biocide optimisation programs\nin once-through systems that have macrofouling problems.\nIn open recirculating systems, microfouling is much more important than macrofouling.\nMonitors of microfouling, such as the ATP method and the “plate count technique\" give\nimportant information on the development and the state of the microfouling population in the\nCWS. To prevent entrainment of organisms and nutrients with the cooling water, the intake\nwater can be pre-treated (e. g. microfiltration, precipitation). Side-stream filtration, the\ncontinuous filtration of a part of the recirculating water volume, further helps to reduce the\namount of organic material in the cooling water. The amount of biocide required for successful\ntreatment can thus be reduced. Side-stream filters should preferably be closed temporarily\nduring shock dosing of biocide, which will avoid unnecessary biocide demand by the filter and\navoid killing the microbial population on the filter.\nIn recirculating cooling water systems, oxidising and non-oxidizing biocides are used. In the\nNetherlands approximately 90% of recirculating systems are treated with sodium hypochlorite.\nNon-oxidising biocides are only used when oxidising biocides cannot provide sufficient\nprotection. For oxidising and non-oxidising biocides discontinuous or shot dosing is\nrecommended to minimise their use, although in some cases continuous halogenation at low\nlevels may consume less chemcial than shot dosing. This will also reduce the risk of\ndevelopment of a tolerance of the biology. Accurate chemical analytical field methods for non-\noxidising biocides are needed to optimise their use. The possibilities for hypochlorite\nmeasurement have been mentioned before. Biological methods for measurement of biocide\nconcentrations in the cooling water may also be useful in recirculating systems.\nIf possible, it is recommended to close or reduce the purge during shock dosing of both\noxidising and non-oxidising biocides, in order to reduce emissions of active biocide. This is\nespecially effective for fast reacting or disintegrating biocides. It is further recommended to\noperate a recirculating CWS treated with hypochlorite at a pH value of 8-9, in order to minimise\nevaporation losses of HOCL over the cooling tower. Experience has shown that this does not\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nnecessarily lead to reduced effectiveness of the biocide. It is important though to manage the\nrisk of scaling.\nThe combined use of hypochlorite and bromide may be an attractive option in freshwater CWS,\nand also in once-through CWS, since some by-products - the brominated amines - have a\nstronger biocidal effect than their chlorinated homologues and they degrade more quickly.\nIn recirculating systems with a high water quality, ozone may be an option. It is important here\nto pay attention to the risk of corrosion. A few experiences in Europe have been successful with\nthe application of ozone. Finally, UV-light may also offer possibilities in recirculating systems\nas a supplementary technique. UV-light alone however, cannot attack the biofouling that has\nsettled on the surfaces of the CWS. In order to be effective, relatively clear cooling water is\nneeded, since the light must be able to penetrate into the water column.\nThe “approach” can be summarised as follows:\n1. The availability of water, amongst other factors, will decide on the selected cooling\nconfiguration (once-through, open or closed wet cooling tower or hybrid cooling tower).\nThe configuration chosen may in turn affect the kind of water treatment. These generally\ndiffer between once-through and open wet cooling towers, such as the application of\noxidising or non-oxidising biocides.\n2. Once a system choice has been made (see also Chapter 1), a complex assessment scheme\nwill have to be applied to match the numerous combinations between the following options\nwhich further affect the need for cooling water treatment:\n• \nchoice of material and surface treatment of heat exchangers and conduits:\n• \nlay-out of the cooling system to avoid turbulence, sediments or mussel growth, or to\nenhance the required water velocity;\n• \nimprove the cooling water chemistry by pre-treatment;\n• \nmechanical cleaning of the cooling system;\n• \nalternative treatments, such as thermal, UV and side stream filtration.\nDepending on the result of this assessment a wet cooling system might still need a certain\nprotection against scaling, corrosion or fouling. This depends on the chemistry of the cooling\nwater, on the way the system is operated, such as the number of cycles of concentration, and the\ncooling configuration chosen.\nIt is clear that for closed circuit dry air-cooling or dry air-cooled condensers no such treatment is\nnecessary. Chemicals might be used to clean the outside (finned) tubes, but usually not for\noperating the system.\nOnce the need for a cooling water treatment has been established, an accurate selection of the\ncooling water treatment program linked to legislative requirements is appropriate. These\nrequirements can be:\n• \nprohibition of the use of certain substances for cooling water treatment, e.g. chromium,\nmercury compounds, organometallic compounds, nitrites, mercaptobenzothiazoles;\n• \nlimitation of certain substances or groups of substances (e.g. zinc, phosphorus, chlorine,\nAOX) in the cooling water effluent by defining emission limit values;\n• \nrequirement of a minimum level of biodegradability for complexing agents;\n• \nlimitation of ecotoxicological effects of the cooling water effluent.\nThe selection of additives for cooling water treatment for both new and existing systems with\nthe following “approach” will lead to a reduction in emissions of cooling water chemicals:\n1. establish the need for cooling water treatment after other physical cleaning methods have\nbeen applied;\n2. select the type of additives required;\n3. assess the environmental risk of the substances to be applied;\n4. apply substances which have lower potential for impact on the environment; where possible.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.4.3.2 Reduction by selection of material and systems design\nFor new system’s material and design options can be applied to reduce additive use. Many\ndifferent materials are used for cooling systems equipment. Equipment suppliers usually offer\ntheir equipment in a wide range of different metals and alloys so as to enable the operator to\nselect the material fit for the chemistry of the cooling water and process conditions it is intended\nfor. Annex IV discusses materials for once-through and open recirculating systems using\nbrackish or salt water. It is important to realize that some features of a material can have\nopposite characters, which may complicate material selection and will affect the cooling water\ntreatment programme. For example, reduced corrosiveness may go together with a higher\nsensitivity to biofouling.\nProper layout and construction of a cooling system can influence the need for cooling water\nadditives. During assemble, unnecessary ridges should be avoided as well as abrupt changes in\nthe direction of the water flow. Both lead to turbulence and where possible this should be\navoided as it enhances corrosion or settling of e.g. mussels.\nOperating the system with the appropriate minimum water velocity not only maintains the\nrequired cooling capacity, but also reduces settlement of macrofouling and corrosion of\nmaterial.\nCoatings and paints are applied to reduce the fixation of the organisms, reinforce the velocity\neffect and facilitate cleaning. These antifouling paints can contain toxic substances and\ntherefore non-toxic coatings and paints have been developed. Applicability underwater and\nprice vary and depend on the size of the cooling system and conditions. E.g. organic coatings\nare applied to relatively smaller cooling units by means of thermal curing of the surface. These\nare powder coatings, which can be used in wet environments and do not contain toxic\nsubstances, do not use solvents and are corrosion resistant resulting in significant extension of\nequipment life.\nIn larger wet cooling systems coatings are applied as well and experience in the power industry\nshows that they have to be renewed every 4 to 5 years. An example is given in Annex XI.\nAntifouling paints have been applied that contain toxic substances, such as copper and\ntributyltinoxide (TBTO), that are slowly released from the paint. No paints containing TBTO\nare still in use in large installations such as power plants. Copper-containing paints may still be\nused on a limited scale.\n3.4.4 Reduction by application of additional and alternative cooling water\ntreatment\nA number of techniques has been applied to reduce cooling water treatment. The following\ntechniques have been reported for the reduction of biocide use [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner,\n1996] :\n- \nFiltration and pre-treatment techniques\n- \nOn-line cleaning\n- \nOff-line cleaning\n- \nHeat treatment\n- \nCoatings and paints\n- \nUltraviolet (UV)-light\n- \nSonic technology\n- \nOsmotic shock.\nThe principle behind these techniques is to improve the biological quality of the cooling water\nand to keep surfaces of the cooling systems elements (conduits and heat exchanger) as clean as\npossible, creating an environment in the system in which development of fouling will be\nreduced. The application of these techniques is summarised in Annex XI and it is obvious that\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nsome may not have general application or are still under investigation. Environmental benefits\nshould be balanced against the reduced application of chemicals.\nFor example, UV-light needs relatively clear water, whereas ozone and sonic technology will\nneed extra energy input. Electric water treatment applied to a very small size cooling system\n(< 1 m3/min) operating at temperatures of 30 – 40 °C gave promising results as a non-chemical\nmicrobial control method, but needs further research.\nFinancial costs may vary with the size of the system and the extent to which the techniques must\nbe integrated in the cooling system.\nPre-treatment of water for recirculating wet cooling systems to reduce cooling water additive\nuse can be considered in the same light as pre-treatment of water to reduce water requirements\n(see Section 3.3.1.2). Pre-treatment will affect the chemistry of the cooling water, such as\nlowering the salt content, which will affect the required level of scale and corrosion inhibition,\nand will affect the way the cooling system is operated.\nHowever, little has been reported on the effect of pre-treatment of cooling water on the\nreduction of cooling water additive use, but inverted osmosis for closed cooling circuits and\nsidestream filtration for open cooling systems with larger capacities have reportedly given good\nresults (Annex XI). Lower costs for water intake, for treatment of the blowdown and for dosage\nof corrosion inhibitors, scale inhibitors and dispersants were reported. No redesign of the\ncooling system was necessary.\n3.4.5 Reduction of emissions by assessment and selection of cooling\nwater additives\nAfter all technological and operational measures have been evaluated, assessment and selection\nof additives for cooling water conditioning is the next step to be taken towards the application of\nsubstances having lower potential for causing environmental impact if properly used. In Section\n3.4.1 and more extensively in Annex V, the theory behind the treatment of cooling water has\nbeen described and the selection of the right treatment program clearly is a site-specific and\nvery complex exercise. It takes into account many factors such as the applied material of the\ninstallation, the water quality and the operating practice. As a result of this a large number of\ncompounds and their combinations have been developed and are currently applied in cooling\nwater treatment compounds.\nTheir performance in the cooling circuit is evaluated and balanced with the residual reactivity in\nthe aquatic environment after discharge. The challenge here is to select an additive effective in\nthe cooling system, but harmless as soon as it leaves the cooling system and enters the receiving\naquatic system.\nThe application of different kinds of cooling water chemicals in different kinds of cooling\nsystems has been reported in the literature. It appears that their environmental impact is\ncomplex and depends on many different factors. Examples show clearly that optimised\noperation reduces the required amount of additives and that it can also lead to the application of\ndifferent types of additives. (See 3.4.6).\nGenerally, in the EU, the assessment of chemicals is regarded as necessary and attempts have\nbeen made to develop an integrated methodology to reduce the environmental effects of their\nuse, but the difficulties encountered on both a national and a European scale are that:\n• \nthere is a variety of evaluation methods used for various applications;\n• \nthe availability of data on substances and components of preparations is (still) a problem;\n• \na variety of parties are responsible for the evaluation of substances;\n• \nrisk-based assessment in many countries still has to be developed.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTo control the application and enhance the use of alternatives, knowledge of characteristics of\ntreatment chemicals in some member States has been translated into legislative requirements for\ncooling water treatment chemicals. German legislation is quoted below as example.\nThe Annex 31 of the German Federal Water Act on cooling water emissions is an example of\nlegislation aiming at optimisation of the use of cooling water additives and on the conservation\nof the quality of surface waters. It has resulted in restrictions on the input of certain substances,\nsuch as biocides and other substances, and covers all wet-cooling systems (See Annex VI).\nThis regulations is based on four steps:\n1. a list of prohibited substances, which contains:\n- \nchromium compounds\n- \nmercury compounds\n- \norganometallic compounds (e.g. organotin compounds)\n- \nmercaptobenzothiazole\n- \norganic complexing agents which are not readily biodegradable\n- \nno shock treatment with biocidal substances other than chlorine, bromine, ozone and H2O2\n2. limitation of certain substances and groups of substances in the effluent concerning:\n- \nchlorine dioxide, chlorine and bromine\n- \nAOX\n- \nCOD\n- \nPhosphorous compounds (inorganic and total/ phosphonates)\n- \nZn\n3. requirement of ready biodegradability of all organic substances used, where the applicable\nrequirement “ready biodegradability” is in accordance with the Chemical Act and Part C4 of\nthe Annex to Directive 92/69 EC (31 July 1992)\n4. limitation of the ecotoxic effects of the total cooling water effluent of biocidal substances\nused does not prohibit their use as it would make the application of microbiocidal\nsubstances impossible. However, they can be essential for the operation and proper\nfunctioning of open and semi-open cooling water systems. The regulations require\ninformation on the level and character of toxicity and call for this to be expressed in a\nreproducible manner. Use is made of biotests such as dilution factor (TL) to express the\nresidual toxicity in the discharge compared to the toxicity in the cooling system.\nDespite legislative limits on the use of a number of cooling water chemicals, a large number of\nadditives is available and assessment and selection of alternatives is required taking into account\nsite-specific factors such as the cooling systems operation and the sensitivity of the receiving\nenvironment. Also, a translation of specific national regulation would fall short of the general\napplicability within the framework of a horizontal “approach”.\nThus, substitution of substances by others, which have lower potential for impact on the\nenvironment, is one of the options to reduce the environmental impact of cooling water\ndischarges. Permitting authorities in the Netherlands have been using the instrument of\nsubstitution for more than 20 years in permitting procedures. The basis of this instrument is a\nprocedure of approval in permits. By means of a more or less administrative procedure permit\nholders have to submit a request for the use and change of cooling water additives. Permitting\nauthorities use a widely approved procedure for this assessment. It is expected that in the near\nfuture chemical suppliers and industry will move to a system of self-regulation. The revision of\nthe system is part of the adoption of a general evaluation methodology to identify the water\npollution effects of substances and preparations. This evaluation methodology is based on the\nEuropean legislation on classification, packaging and labelling (67/548/EEC, 99/45/EC).\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nIn general terms the assessment of cooling water additives takes place in three steps [Benschop\n(1998)]. The first step is an assessment of the intrinsic properties of substances. Substances are\nevaluated on the basis of their ecotoxicological characteristics (carcinogenicity, acute aquatic\ntoxicity, biodegradation, Log Pow and bioconcentration factor). In order to be able to evaluate\nthe substances and preparations, it is necessary to know the substance or the precise\ncomposition of a preparation. International industrial programmes (Responsible care, ICCA),\nEuropean legislation (Biocidal Products Directive) and the development of chemicals\nmanagement on the EU-level contribute to those data on properties of substances becoming\nmore and more available.\nThe first step results in an indication of the hazard potential of the additive. The evaluation and\nselection through the assessment of the hazardousness applies a hazard identification test to\nsubstances and to their preparations. It is a test which has been developed in the Netherlands\n([tm070, Benschop, 1997] and [tm071, Niebeek, 1997]) and is particularly based on the\nDangerous Substance Directive (67/548/EEC) and the Directive Hazardous Preparations\n(88/379/EEC). The test focuses on the ecotoxicological characteristics of a substance. This\ninvolves mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, acute toxicity and biodegradibility, log Pow and the\nbioconcentration factor. However, this needs data that are not always readily available, partly\nfor reasons of confidentiality and partly because data have not been collected yet.\nTo evaluate or benchmark additives with alternatives, which have lower impact on the receiving\nenvironment, can assist in the assessment and selection. In Annex VIII.1 an example is given of\nhow at site level a benchmark method could be applied to get a first indication of the potential\nfor impact of the proposed alternative additives. This benchmark is designed for an open wet\nrecirculating cooling system (open cooling tower). It aims to calculate a “standard” PEC for a\npreliminary evaluation of PEC in the river. It is a simplified model assuming that there is no\ndilution of the additive in the river, thus overestimating the concentration of the substance in the\nreceiving waterway. Also, PEC is assumed to be independent of the size of the plant and the\noperating conditions as the model takes into account the feed rate of the chemical(s). The\navailability of environmental quality standards (EQS) of the chemicals as provided by the Water\nFramework Directive is important.\nThe second step involves optimisation steps to reduce the use of the selected additives by all\nsorts of operational steps (see next Section 3.4.6). In the third step the residual discharge is then\nevaluated in comparison with the applicable water quality objectives or environmental quality\nstandards (EQS). If these objectives are not reached, further measures may be indicated. When\nalternative additives are available the need to take measures can be avoided by substitution of\nhazardous additives by less hazardous alternatives.\nThe added value of this procedure of assessment of additives related to the regulation on\nchemicals based on the above-mentioned EU directives is:\n1. the ability to identify additives with the lowest environmental impact and\n2. the ability to determine whether local water quality objectives are met.\nIf this assessment method (which is generally applicable for substances and compounds) is\napplied to biocides, the first step automatically results in the need to take further measures. In\npractice, this means conducting a study for an optimisation programme for the use and dosage\nof the biocide. The second step, which more or less runs parallel with the study for optimisation,\ninvolves the evaluation of predicted effects on the local aquatic ecosystem.\nWith this evaluation three criteria are being checked and, if all three criteria are met, further\nreduction measures including effluent treatment and/or substitution of the additive should be\napplied. In the Netherlands the predicted concentration of a biocide is checked against the\nMaximum Admissible Risk Level (MARL).\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFurther measures should then be applied if:\n1. the concentration of biocide in the effluent is higher than the MARL, and if;\n2. the added concentration of biocide in surface water on a certain distance from the discharges\nexceeds more than X % of the MARL, and if;\n3. the total concentration of biocide in surface water at a certain distance from the discharge\nexceeds the MARL.\nThe assessment procedure described is illustrated in more detail in Appendix VIII.2.\n3.4.6 Optimising the use of cooling water additives\nOptimising the use of cooling water additives also means selecting the appropriate dosage\nregime and monitoring the effects of the water treatment programme both on the emissions to\nthe surface water and on the performance of the cooling system in terms of heat transfer and\nsafety. It is obvious that both techniques are linked and that monitoring is a prerequisite for the\nappropriate dosage regime.\nThe selection of a dosage regime should aim to achieve the required concentration at the right\ntime, without a reduction of the performance of the cooling system. Underdosage can cause\ncorrosion or scaling and a reduced performance of the cooling system which also leads to\nindirect environmental effects, and an overdose of chemicals can result in fouling of heat\nexchange surfaces, higher emission levels and higher treatment costs. Graphically this can be\nrepresented as in Figure 3.4. In the improperly designed system no account is taken of the\nrequired minimum concentration of a biocide to keep the system protected against fouling, so\nsome fouling may occur. At the same time overdosing leads up to such concentration levels that\nmore than the maximum required concentration is available. At that moment excess additive\nwill be discharged into the environment.\nTime\nConcentration\nupper spec limit\nlower spec limit\ntarget\nFigure 3.4: Additive concentration pattern resulting of improperly designed monitoring and dosage\nregime\nTargeted dosage (Figure 3.5) based on analysis of the cooling water quality aims at maintaining\nthe minimum required concentration level to give constant protection. Excessive concentration\nlevels are avoided and thus discharge into the environment is reduced, which will also reduce\ncosts to purchase the treatment. For this, properly designed dosage regimes will reduce the\namount of additive needed and can be considered as a cost-effective measure.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTime\nConcentration\nupper spec limit\nlower spec limit\ntarget\nFigure 3.5: Additive concentration pattern resulting of properly designed monitoring and dosage\nregime\n3.4.6.1 Dosage of cooling water additives\n3.4.6.1.1 \nDosage regimes\n([tm010, Betz, 1991], [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996] , [tm157, Jenner et al, 1998])\nDosage of cooling water chemicals is done in the following ways (see also Annexes V and XI):\n• \ncontinuous\n\u0001 \nend of season\n\u0001 \nperiodic during settlement\n\u0001 \nlow level during settlement\n• \nintermittent (also called shot, batch)\n• \nsemi-continuous or pulse-alternating\n• \nmassive or shock dosage, where a large amount of chemical is added to the cooling water at\nonce.\nContinuous dosage is practised in cooling systems where a certain level of additive has to be\nmaintained constantly. The better systems feed according to the volume being treated and the\nchemical demand requirements. It is still applied in once-through systems predominantly against\nmacrofouling and corrosion. However, experiences show that reduced use through changed\ndosage practice can be just as effective.\nWith intermittent dosage the chemical is fed by an on/off control on a chemical feed pump or by\ndischarge from a calibrated vessel or measuring chamber. Batch dosage is applied in cooling\nsystems, bio-oxidation basins, and other places where the system volume to blowdown ratio is\nlarge. In these systems the amount of chemical replenishes lost or consumed material. It is also\nused in applications that only require periodic dosage. For instance, antimicrobials for cooling\nwater systems are usually fed in a discontinuous way. Batch dosage can both be applied in\nrecirculating systems and once-through systems. It cannot be used in single once-through\nsystems where a uniform concentration of chemical is needed.\nDosage can also be targeted on specific areas in the cooling system such as at the entrance to\nheat exchangers. An important practice is time-targeted dosage matched with seasonal\ncharacteristics of macrobiological growth. Dosage will also depend on the type of cooling\nsystem. In recirculating systems the way the system is operated will affect the timing and\namount of dosage. In once-through system, the point and time of dosage is important to obtain\nthe highest effect, as contact time between chemical and cooling water is short.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nIn small systems dosage is done manually, but in larger systems there is usually an automatic\ndevice linked to a monitoring system. As mentioned before, there is a tendency towards\noutsourcing the cooling water treatment to specialist companies. For large and complex\ninstallations with several cooling systems, specialised staff from suppliers are permanently on-\nsite to operate these systems. With smaller systems, daily control is often done by site staff and\nsupported by regular control by the supplier.\nWith optimisation of dosage reduction of biocide use can be achieved. The way in which\nbiocides are being dosed depends on the working and persistence of the biocide, the type and\nseasonal pattern of fouling (macro/micro), the state of fouling of the cooling system, the system\nwater temperature and the nutrient status of the cooling water. Biocides are dosed in gaseous,\nliquid or solid forms.\nDosage can be continuous or shock. In some of the literature it is advocated that continuous\ndosage should take place in once-through systems to extend the contact time of antimicrobials\nwhen dosage low levels. For recirculating systems continuous dosage is also possible, but\nintermittent dosage is more common. The purpose of intermittent treatment in these systems is\nto generate a high concentration of antimicrobial, which will penetrate and disrupt the biofilm\nand eventually dissipate. Compared to continuous treatment intermittent treatment can lead to\nlower average annual concentrations in the effluent and can also be more cost effective, where\nlower total amounts are needed. However, this has also been argued as observations were made\nthat continuous dosage could give a reduction of 40% of FO compared to shock dosage. More\nresearch on this will be needed as in general from an operators’ point of view continuous dosage\nis easier to operate than shock or intermittent dosage. This will need a monitoring system to\ndecide on the appropriate moment to apply the treatment. The optimisation of the dosing regime\nmust take place with achieving a low incidence of failure at the same time.\nIn recirculating systems use of products composed of synergistic active blends can result in\nreduced treatment concentrations in the blowdown water, as well as cost savings. Biocides with\ndifferent spectrums can be dosed in combination as to broaden the spectrum of control. With no\nincrease in the amount of antimicrobial used, the power of a blend can exceed the effect\nexpected from a single additive effect. This greatly enhanced performance or synergism is\nobtained from only certain combinations of additives. The feeding does not necessarily be done\nsimultaneously, but can be done alternating with similar results. Another effect is that resistance\nis less likely to occur in the case of more than one microbial being applied against which it is\nunlikely that the microbes will have developed resistance to both (or all) at the same time.\nInteractions between different substances will have to be considered to avoid reduction of the\nworking of any of the biocides dosed and to avoid hazardous reaction products develop in the\ncooling water discharge.\nThe objective of biocidal treatment can be different. Depending on the target organisms and the\nextent to which biofouling has progressed, treatments are either preventive or curative. A\nbiocide that has been researched intensively is sodium hypochlorite. Dosage of hypochlorite\ninto a once-through system shows that the cooling system will function as a tube reactor, with\nmany complex reactions taking place between hypochlorite and organic matter. As a result of\nsuch reactions, and for a typical location, using estuarine or coastal cooling water, a\nhypochlorite dose at the intake, ranging from 1.5 - 3 mg Cl2/l, will result in a dose of 0.25 – 0.35\nmg/1 of TRO at the outlet of the heat exchanger. This refers to approximately 4 - 8 minutes of\nreaction time. To reduce the dosage of hypochlorite considerably, pulse-chlorination has been\napplied (Annex XI.3.3.2.1 and X.3.3.2.1).\n3.4.6.1.2 \nDosage systems\n([tm010, Betz, 1991])\nThere are several dosage systems on the market. For the choice of dosage system one should\ndistinguish between liquid and dry chemicals. For liquid chemicals, pumps are used such as\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nmetering pumps, packed plunger pumps (high pressure) and diaphragm pumps. For dry\nchemicals dosage systems are applied such as volumetric feeders (to dispense powdered\nmaterial), gravimetric feeders (proportioning chemicals by weight) and dissolving feeders\n(dosage into mixing tank). Whether and how the different dosage systems applied actually\nreduce the consumption of additives has not been reported. It is beyond doubt that proper\nmaintenance of the system and calibration will improve the dosage accuracy. The quantity,\nlocation and timing of dosage can only be controlled in an accurate way by properly monitoring\nthe water cooling system.\n3.4.6.2 Monitoring of cooling water\nMonitoring of the need for chemicals for treatment of cooling water is essential to reduce\nadditive use and emissions into the environment, generally the surface water. It can be seen as a\ncost-effective method, where treatment of discharge water, if possible at all, is generally more\nexpensive.\nDistinction can be made between the monitoring of the application of biocides and monitoring\nof other water treatment chemicals (scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors and dispersants),\nbecause in the case of macrofouling an important additional factor is the monitoring of the\nbehaviour of the biology appearing in the cooling system.\n3.4.6.2.1 \nMonitoring of scale inhibitors, corrosion inhibitors and dispersants\n([tm067, Hoots et al, 1993])\nThe application of inhibitor chemicals and the optimisation of their use is a very complex matter\nand specific for each situation. In every case it will be a balance between a number of factors:\n• \nthe quality of the cooling water and the options for pre-treatment (softening, filtration),\nwhich in its turn depend on the required flow;\n• \nthe need for reducing water requirements by increasing the number of cycles against the\nincrease of scaling problems due to the increased concentration;\n• \nthe cooling water temperature against the solubility of salts;\n• \nthe interaction between additives.\nSeveral methods are applied for controlling the dosage of cooling water inhibitor products in\nrecirculating cooling systems. In an overview [tm067, Hoots et al, 1993]. The following general\ntechniques were distinguished as being applied in cooling systems:\n• \nmanual testing and adjusting\n• \nbleed and feed (blowdown-activated feed)\n• \nwater meter controlled cycles\n• \nsidestream chemical analyser (microprocessor based)\n• \nfluorescence.\nEach method obviously has its advantages and disadvantages. The principle of the optimised\npattern shown in Figure 3.5 may not be reached. The various monitoring techniques differ in\ntheir potential to dose the proper amount. A variation in the dosage which is not linked to\nfluctuations in the cooling system demand should however be avoided as much as possible. It\nmay lead to an under dose or overdose of chemicals.\nVariation in dosage can occur for a number of reasons:\n• \noperator may be insufficiently involved\n• \nequipment has low reliability\n• \nindirect measurement of chemical level\n• \nmeasurement of wrong variable\n• \ntime lag between the analysis and the adjustment is too large\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n• \nrepeatability of the method of analysis may be low\n• \nvariations in cooling load and makeup water quality are not followed accurately.\nFrom experience it is obvious that the most accurate monitoring and dosage systems directly\nmeasure the concentrations of chemicals in the cooling water and have a reduced time between\nanalysis and the adjustment of the dosage. Monitoring systems should be able to follow the\nchanges in cooling load and the variation in makeup water quality (Annex XI).\n3.4.6.2.2 \nMonitoring of biofouling\n([tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996] and ([tm087, Engstrom and Tully, 1994])\nThe monitoring of biofouling is based on the monitoring of microbiological activity in the\ncooling system as well as the actual microbiocide treatment levels. The key to measuring the\neffectiveness of any biocide program is the ability to measure quickly and accurately the\nmicrobiological activity in the cooling system.\nTo obtain a good dosage regime the following strategy for once-through systems has been\nsuggested:\n• \nmake a problem analysis on the organism(s) to target\n• \ncharacterise seasonal differences in occurrence (e.g. breeding period of mussels)\n• \ntake into account water temperature and water quality (fresh/salt)\n• \nselect a dosage programme (e.g. locally per section: continuously or intermittently)\n• \ndecide on the dosage units that will reduce consumption especially if linked to a monitoring\nsystem\n• \ndecide on the monitoring programme (mussel detection tank (breeding period\ndetermination) or mussel/oyster monitor (concentration detection)\nA similar strategy could apply to open recirculating wet systems. However, the dosage\nprogramme for additives used in cooling towers also covers inhibitor chemicals, which further\nincreases the complexity of a treatment. An additional factor is the effect of operation with an\nincreaded number of cycles of concentration, which saves water on the one hand, but increases\nthe possibility of scaling and corrosion and the need for specific additives on the other hand. In\nthis situation less corrosion-sensitive materials may be the obvious choice in the design phase of\nnew installations. They could reduce the need for inhibitors (see 3.4.3.2), enabling operation\nwithout adding complex agents, which at the same time saves on costs.\nFor both new and existing cooling systems it is important to establish the cause of biofouling\n(e.g. leakage) and to characterise the organisms first before deciding any further on the required\nbiocide.\nFor once-through systems, macrofouling is of major importance. A prerequisite for biocide\ntreatment is monitoring of macrofouling. This is essential to establish the minimum required\nbiocide dose and for biocide optimisation, as it will give information on the settlement and\ngrowth of macrofouling organisms and on the performance of the biofouling control program.\nAn even more targeted dosage regime is the pulse alternating chlorination which takes account\nof the variation in residence times in different parts of the process. At different times and at\ndifferent points the required levels of chlorine are dosed following the flow patters of the\ncooling water stream in the different process stages. At the end of the process and before\ndischarge of the cooling water, stream dilution occurs by the mixing of the different process\nstreams. Where only one of the streams is chlorinated and the other is not, the TRO can be\nfurther reduced and emission levels of < 0.1 mg/l are achievable (see Annex XI).\nFor open recirculating systems microfouling is much more important than macrofouling. As the\namount of water used for makeup generally is much smaller, both pre-treatment of the water and\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nside-stream filtration of part of the circulating water can prevent the entrainment of micro-\norganisms. In the case of shock dosage of biocides, recirculating systems have the advantage\nthat the system can be closed temporarily, enabling the biocide to perform and thus lowering the\nconcentration before blowdown. Also, for recirculating systems, monitoring of the biofouling\ncontrol program is a prerequisite for optimizing the use of biocides.\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.5 Cooling air use and air emissions\n3.5.1 Air requirements\nThe use of air as a resource has no direct environmental implications and is not regarded as a\nreal consumption. Air is used in all but the once-through cooling systems. In mechanical cooling\ntowers the air requirement is related to the energy required for fan operation.\nTable 3.9: Average required airflow for the different cooling systems\n[tm134, Eurovent, 1998]\nCooling system\nAirflow (%)\nonce-through flow\n\nopen wet cooling tower\n\nopen wet/dry (hybrid) cooling\n\nclosed circuit cooling tower\n\nclosed circuit wet/dry cooling\n\nclosed circuit dry air cooling\n\nThe higher the required amount of air the higher the fan capacity and consequently the level of\nenergy consumption and noise emission. In Table 3.9 the airflow requirements are compared for\nthe various cooling systems. The airflow is strongly correlated with the ratio between sensible\nand latent heat transfer (Annex I). Dry cooling needs more air than wet cooling.\nIn some specific areas (e.g. densely industrialised sites) the air quality could be an issue and by\nits composition could lead to corrosion of the (finned) tubes or coils or to fouling of the surface,\nin both ways adversely affecting efficient heat exchange. Precleaning of cooling air seems\nunrealistic and no information on this has been reported. Consequently, cleaning of the surface\nof the heat exchanger and/or treatment of cooling water might be necessary depending on the\nchemistry of the air.\nOn the other hand, open wet cooling towers sometimes act as air cleaners, washing several\npollutants out of the air. This can affect the cooling water treatment and potentially the\noperation of the cooling system, but no data have been reported.\n3.5.2 Direct and indirect emissions\nEmissions into air due to the operation of industrial cooling systems can be direct or indirect.\nIndirect emissions occur on the level of the production process due to inefficient cooling. They\nare due to the fact that inefficient cooling requires a higher input of resources (such as energy)\nto compensate for product or performance losses.\nThe importance of direct air emissions from wet cooling towers is particularly relevant in the\ndirect vicinity of urban settlements. In comparison with the air emissions of the industrial\nprocess to be cooled, they are considered to be relatively small. Problems that may occur during\noperation are:\n1. droplets may contain some water treatment chemicals;\n2. bacteriae (Legionnaire´s disease) may develop in case of improper biocide treatment and\ncooling tower maintenance (3.7.3).\nOpen and closed recirculating wet and wet/dry cooling towers may show some emissions due to\ndrift and volatilisation, which account for some loss of water treatment chemicals and in\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nparticular of biocides. It is known that volatilisation, also called flash-off, of chemicals increases\nwith temperature, but the mechanism that leads to emissions is complex, with many factors\ninvolved. Therefore, quantification is difficult and no emission data have been reported.\nDrift eliminators are considered to be an important reduction measure. All wet cooling towers\nnowadays are equipped with drift eliminators, but still a small percentage of the circulated water\nstream may be exhausted as water droplets. These droplets containing dissolved particulate and\nchemical additives fall out of the exhaust airstream downwind of the cooling tower and can\ncause staining or scale deposits on building surfaces [tm046, Vanderheyden and Schuyler,\n1994]. Some specific cases are known in which chromium emissions are reported, but most\nMember States have prohibited chromium use for environment and health reasons; it is also\nreported to give technical problems.\nThe quality and quantity of direct air emissions from cooling towers will be specific in each\nsituation depending on the additives used for cooling water treatment, their concentration in the\ncirculating water and the effectiveness of the drift eliminators. The standard droplet separators\ncurrently used in wet cooling towers make it possible to limit the loss of water by drift to 0.01%\nor even less of the total flow rate. An attempt was made to assess cooling tower emissions using\na simplified model [tm046, Vanderheyden and Schuyler, 1994]. From the data obtained it was\nconcluded that emission concentrations are low (µg/m3), but not to be neglected, and that design\nand positioning of the cooling tower outlet are important to avoid inlets of air conditioning\nsystems or other cooling installations.\nCurrently no standardised method exists to calculate drift losses (and environmental\ncontamination) for given cooling tower configurations. Two test methods exist to verify drift\nlosses of given configurations (not published):\n- \nthe isokinetic method (IK-method)\n- \nsensitised surface drift measurement (SS-method)\nBoth methods have their advantages and disadvantages. Advantages of the IK-method are:\n1. High collection efficiency on all droplet sizes,\n2. Analysis of specific elements possible,\n3. Provides integrated sample over exit area,\nThe disadvantages of the IK-method are:\n1. Airborne elements may bias results\n2. Long sample times required for high efficiency drift eliminators or low mineral\nconcentrations.\nA test code exists describing how to conduct the IK-test (CTI-140).\nThe SS-method has the following advantages:\n1. Provides droplet size characteristics above 30 µm,\n2. Not affected by airborne elements,\n3. Provides relative indication of drift eliminators effectiveness,\nDisadvantages of the SS method are:\n1. Poor collection efficiency on small droplets less than 30 µm,\n2. Cannot distinguish between condensation and drift,\n3. No droplet analysis for specific constituents.\nIncidental emissions of asbestos particles have been reported during decommissioning of old\ncooling towers in which asbestos-cement has been used, requiring specialised measures to\ncontain them. A report on the reduction of the emission of asbestos particles during\ndecommissioning focused on protecting against direct inhalation [tm082, Mittendorf, 1990]. As\nthe use of asbestos and similar materials has been banned in the EU no asbestos is used in new\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nor recently built cooling towers. Asbestos can still occur in cooling towers of about 20 years and\nolder.\nAir emission abatement on cooling towers has not been reported and does not seem applicable.\nIn the light of the origin of the potential contamination and the way it is transported, the\nfollowing conclusions have been drawn:\n- \nReduction of air emissions from cooling towers is positively correlated with the integrated\nmeasures for reducing water intake, in particular application of drift eliminators,\n- \nReduction of air emissions is positively correlated with the reduction of the need for cooling\nwater treatment, and\n- \nReduction of air emissions from cooling towers is positively correlated with the\noptimisation of cooling water treatment (optimisation of system operation).\n3.5.3 Cooling tower plumes\n3.5.3.1 Plume formation\nPlume formation can be important in open and closed wet cooling towers when air with a high\nmoisture content leaves the cooling tower, mixes with the atmosphere and begins to cool down.\nDuring this process some of the excess water vapour that has been absorbed is condensed out\nagain. Although this is almost 100% water vapour, the horizon marring effect can be\nconsiderable in case of large towers (power industry, chemical industry). The shape and the\nextent of the visible plume are influenced by the temperature and the relative humidity of the\natmosphere, and also by the wind. The colder and the more humid the atmosphere, the more\nstable and the more persistent the plume will be. It can therefore be considered to be a potential\nproblem of the more temperate or colder regions in Europe and mainly in wintertime. Extreme\nplume formation from large installations (power plants) can also result in fog at ground level in\nthe case of lower towers (40-50 mtr.). It is also reported that, during extreme weather\nconditions, can be formed on roads ice as a result of large plume formation followed by\nprecipitation.\n3.5.3.2 Plume abatement\n[tm101, BDAG, 1996], [tm123, Alt and Mäule, 1987]\nPlume abatement is a technological integrated measure changing the configuration of the\ncooling system. Plume formation can be prevented, drying the wet exhaust air before it is\ndischarged, by mixing it with some warm dry air. Open hybrid (or wet/dry) cooling towers and\nclosed wet/dry cooling towers (or recoolers) are designed in particular to prevent plume\nformation. (See Section 2.6)\nDepending on the climatic conditions and the requirements of the process, the tower can be\noperated dry. For northern European climatic conditions it is maintained that it only needs 20%\nof the total heat load to be transferred in the dry section for the cooling tower to operate without\na visible plume, under virtually all weather conditions. In certain conditions, such as at very low\nambient temperature and a low thermal load, the tower can also be operated in entirely dry\nmode. Regulations sometimes distinguish between day and night operation and allow wet\ncooling (with a plume) during the night, whereas in daytime the tower must be operated in\nhybrid mode, preventing plume formation. (See also Chapter 2).\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n3.6 Noise emissions\n3.6.1 Sources of noise and noise levels\nNoise emissions are important at a local level. Noise emissions from an industrial complex\nresult from a range of noise-producing sources and in the practice of permit writing cooling\nsystem noise is considered as an integral part of the whole site. Consequently, noise from\ncooling systems and the investment on potential attenuation measures should be evaluated\nwithin the total noise emissions of a site. Noise emissions are generally an issue of both\nmechanical draught cooling towers and large natural draught wet cooling towers. For\ninformation on characteristics and calculations of noise emissions of sound sources in cooling\ntowers, reference can be made to the VDI-Directive 3734 and to standards developed in the\nGerman VGB-guidelines for cooling systems of power plants [tm158, VGB, 1998].\nThree main sources of noise caused by these cooling systems can be identified:\n•\nfan assemblies (fan, gears, drive) - all mechanical cooling towers;\n•\npumps - all systems with cooling water\n•\ndroplets falling on the cooling water basin/ cascading watermasses - only wet cooling\ntowers.\nRadiation can be directly or indirectly. The sound is directly radiated through:\n• \npoints of air intake\n• \npoints of air discharge\nThe sound is indirectly radiated through:\n• \nfan motors\n• \nfan discharge cowls and cooling tower cladding (with concrete constructions there is no\nsignificant contribution)\nNoise from dry air-cooled towers is predominantly influenced by the mechanical equipment\napplied and the way it is operated. In cases where attenuation has resulted in a very low sound\npower level of the equipment, noise from heat exchangers or condenser pipes and conduits may\nbecome predominant.\nIn wet cooling towers, noise is a result of the falling water droplets only (natural draught) or of\nboth the falling droplets and the mechanical equipment. Generally the unattenuated noise of fans\nis dominant compared to the noise of water droplets. This is reported to be irrespective of the\nsize of the wet cooling tower. When air-related noise is reduced by attenuation measures, water-\nrelated noise may become dominant and water noise attenuation may be considered.\nFor medium to large cooling towers operated in power stations and large industrial plants the\nfollowing was reported. For natural draught cooling towers, water flow and tower height are the\nmost important factors affecting unattenuated noise emission levels. Falling height of the\ndroplets is important up to 5 m., but with larger falling heights no further influence on the total\nnoise was reported. The sound power level at the inlet can be calculated according to the\nequation:\nLw (dB(A)) = 68 + 10 * (log M/M0) ±2\nM0 = 1 tonne/hr\nThe sound power level at the air outlet of natural draft cooling towers can be approximately\ncalculated with the following equation:\nLw (dB(A)) = 71 + 10 * (log M/M0) - 0.15 * (H/H0) ±5\nM0 = 1 tonne/hr (M = weight rate of water flow)\nH0 = 1 m\n(H = height of the cooling tower)\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFor fan operated wet cooling towers the spectrum of water noise at the inlet is not much\ndifferent. For cooling towers with induced draught (fan in top of tower) the contribution of the\nwater noise in the air outlet (diffuser) to the total sound power level can be calculated\napproximately using the following equation:\nLw (dB(A)) = 72 + 10 * (log M/M0) ±3\nM0 = 1 tonne/hr\nThe most relevant factor in mechanical cooling towers is the mechanical equipment used (fans,\ngears, etc). Fan tip speed (25-60 m/s) is a major influence on the total noise level. The type of\nfans used (centrifugal or axial) as well as the number and type of blades are also of importance.\nIt was reported that use of gearboxes can have negative influence on the sound level (at the\nsame water flow and fan tip speed), if the fan speed is reduced (e.g. nighttime operation), when\nthey become more dominant.\nThe sound power level of a fan can be calculated approximately using the equation:\nLw (dB(A)) = 16 + 10 * (log V/V0) + 20 * (∆p/∆p0) ±5\n(V0 = 1 m3 of air/h; ∆p0 = 1 hPa)\nThis general equation can be used for both forced and induced draught fans. In forced draught\ntowers the contribution of the fans to the sound power level at the air outlet of medium to large\ncooling towers will generally be less than the contribution of a fan of an induced draught tower\nwith the fans at the top. This difference can be up to 5 dB(A).\nThe following equation was used showing how the sound power level of axial fans is related to\nthe tip speed of the fan:\nLw (dB(A)) = C + 30 log Utip + 10 log (Q*P) – 5 log Dfan\n(C = fan characteristic shape value, Utip = fan tip speed, Q = fan flow, P = fan pressure\ndrop, Dfan = fan diameter)\nNoise emissions also depend on the construction of the cooling tower. Noise from concrete\ntowers is entirely emitted through the air inlet and air outlet. For cooling towers made of\ndifferent lighter material, emission from the shell will have to be taken into account.\nFurthermore, counter-flow or cross-flow design also affects the sound emission of wet cooling\ntowers, where counter-flow is reported to have more splash noise than cross-flow designs.\nNoise emissions can be characterised by the different frequencies they consist of and distinction\ncan be made between natural wet draught cooling towers and mechanical cooling towers.\nFalling water in natural draught towers shows a broad frequency band, whereas the noise of fans\nof mechanical cooling towers predominantly consists of low frequencies. This, amongst other\nfactors, can explain why water noise typically prevails in near-field conditions around the\ninstallation, while the noise of the fans will become progressively predominant with increasing\ndistance from a fan operated cooling tower.\nThe sound power levels of different cooling towers show a large variation and each single\nsource will contribute to the total emission. This is illustrated by examples in Table 3.11 for\npower stations [tm158, VGB, 1998] and in Table 3.10 showing values for the different cooling\nsystems used in a refinery [tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997].\nNoise levels of the falling water in wet cooling towers depend on the drop height of the water.\nLower drop height in induced draught wet cooling towers results in about 1 dB(A) lower sound\npower level at the air inlet and of a so called cell type cooling tower with induced draught,\n3 dB(A) lower.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable 3.10: Examples of capacity and associated unattenuated sound power levels of cooling\nsystems equipment of a large refinery\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nEquipment\nCapacity1\nLw in dB(A)\nCompressors\n490/ 2000 \nkW\n108/ 119\nPumps\n25/ 100/ 1300 \nkW\n94/ 98/ 108\nSteam turbines\n1000/ 2000 \nkW\n106/ 108\nAir-coolers\n7 /20 / 60 \nkW\n89/ 93/ 98\nAir-cooler/condenser\n\nkW\n\nAir-cooler/condenser\n2.7 \nMWth\n\nAir-cooler\n14.7 MWth/ 18.8\nkWe\n\nAir-cooler\n1.5 MWth/ 7.5\nkWe\n\nCooling towers\n\nMWth\n\nCooling tower\n\nm3/hour\n\nNotes:\n1.\nreference to the capacity of the rotating part, motor, etc., i.e. not cooling capacity.\nTable 3.11: Comparison of unattenuated sound power levels at air inlet and air outlet measured at\nvarious types of wet cooling towers of conventional construction\n[tm158, VGB, 1998]\nWet cooling tower\nconstruction\nAt air inlet in dB(A)\nAt air outlet (diffusor opening)\nin dB(A)\nNatural draught\n84 ± 3\n69 ± 3\nOpen wet cooling tower\n86 ± 3\n80 ± 3\nOpen wet cooling tower\n(cell type, forced draught)\n88 ± 3\n85 ± 3\nOpen wet cooling tower\n(cell type, induced draught)\n85 ± 3\n88 ± 3\nFor comparison of total sound power levels of various types of cooling systems Table 3.12\ndocuments total noise levels for different types of cooling systems without noise attenuation.\nFrom the above given variation in levels it can be understood that the ranges are wide depending\non the applied design and equipment.\nTable 3.12: Noise emissions of different cooling systems without noise attenuation\n[tm134, Eurovent, 1998]\nCooling system\nNoise emission\ndB(A)\nonce-through flow\ncooling tower-natural draught\n90-100\ncooling tower-mechanical draught\n80-120\nclosed circuit cooling tower\n80-120\nhybrid cooling\n80-120\ndry air cooling\n90-130\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.6.2 Noise abatement\n([tm158, VGB, 1998], [tm061, Eurovent/Cecomaf, 1997], [tm086, Van der Spek, 1993],\n[tm093, Mirsky, 1995])\nNoise abatement should primarily be focused on so called primary measures or “internal”\nmeasures before considering any secondary or “external” measure such as baffles or big\nbarriers. Different guidelines on noise abatement of cooling towers distinguish between noise\ngenerated by cascading water and noise of mechanical equipment. In general, natural draught\ncooling towers are less noisy (unattenuated), but for mechanical draught cooling towers sound\nattenuation is more efficient. Obviously, proper maintenance of the noise generating equipment\nover time can keep the emission down as well. In most cases only mechanical draught cooling\ntowers can meet the noise requirements because only the mechanical draught can economically\novercome the additional airside pressure drop. The selection of less noisy radial fans often\nimplies higher energy consumption and results in higher operating costs than axial fans.\nThe general “approach” is to apply the primary measures first to optimise noise emission. If\nfurther noise reduction is needed additional attenuation can be considered. Noise attenuation\nshould be done bearing in mind the effects of abatement measures, such as pressure drop (more\nenergy required) and other sources becoming more dominant. The contribution of individual\nequipment to the sound emission level must be seen as part of the whole noise pattern. This\nmeans that nearby buildings, dispersal and reverberation, amongst many other factors, must be\ntaken into account as well. To lower the emissions from the different potential noise sources in\ncooling systems the above given equations clearly show on what issue the reduction measures\nshould focus, such as drop height and fan tip speed.\n3.6.2.1 Noise control of cascading water (wet cooling towers)\nIn natural draught cooling towers the sound attenuation focuses on the air inlet, because the air\noutlet contributes insignificantly to the total noise level, at least being 5 dB lower. Sound\ngenerated in the basin by falling water is already reduced to some extent by radiation in the\ntower, the tower fill and the plume (10-15 dB). Further attenuation can reduce the emission\nfrom the air inlet by a further 5-8 dB. The following measures are suggested and could be\napplied to medium to large mechanical cooling towers as well.\n3.6.2.1.1 \nPrimary measures\nThe following techniques have been identified as primary measures:\n• \nLowering the water surface by faster draining of the basin would use the basin walls as\nsound barriers.\n• \nReducing the drop height of the water is possible by minimising the sectional area of the air\ninlet, which is limited.\n• \nAvoiding the impact of droplets in the basin is possible by devices catching the drops and\ndraining them into the basin (impact deflectors) Effect: 7 dB maximum.\n• \nWater collection troughs underneath the fill also have a deflecting effect: 10 dB maximum.\nDisadvantage of the deflection methods is the susceptibility to fouling of the surfaces of the\ncatching devices, which can potentially contaminate the water.\n3.6.2.1.2 \nSecondary measures\nSecondary measures that have been applied are:\n• \nSound attenuators with baffles at the air intake: 20 dB maximum reduction. Disadvantage\ncould be the air pressure drop, which can be about up to 10 Pa. Pressure loss can require\n20% of the installed fan capacity.\n• \nEarth barriers around the tower base: an attenuation effect of 10 dB.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n• \nSound walls (or screens) with sound absorbing layers yield a sound attenuation of 20 dB.\nWith these constructions effectiveness depends on construction and distance to the tower\nbase.\n3.6.2.1.3 \nDry-cooling towers\nNoise from dry cooling towers is predominantly caused by fans, but for medium to large dry-\ncooling towers, the noise of water can become dominating when it flows through the heat\nexchangers at higher velocities. In the case of condensers, the sound may become distinct when\nlow noise equipment is being used, and the flow noise of condenser tubes may reach the same\nmagnitude as the fan noise. In those cases further sound attenuation may become important and\nisolation of connecting pipelines must be considered.\n3.6.2.2 Noise control of mechanical equipment (mechanical draught cooling\ntowers)\nFor the noise control of cascading water in medium to large mechanical draught cooling towers\nthe same primary measures as were mentioned for natural draught towers can be referred to.\nAdditionally applied are:\n• \ngrids or woven structures of fine meshes, drifting on the water surface to reduce the splash\nnoise of falling droplets. No quantification of the reducing effect has been reported.\nNoise attenuation of mechanical equipment refers mainly to reduction of fan-related noise in\nboth wet and dry cooling towers. Applied measures are primary (equipment) or secondary\n(absorption). The various sound attenuation measures achieve noise abatement levels of about\n20 dB(A) and up to 30 dB(A). For these high noise abatement levels it is necessary to combine\nmore quiet equipment with additional sound attenuation, such as acoustic baffles or noise\nattenuators. Such equipment for passive sound attenuation will increase the investment costs,\nbut operating costs remain reasonable.\n3.6.2.2.1 \nPrimary measures\nThe following primary measures have been reported:\n• \nFan measures:\n- \nlow power fans (couple of dB(A) reduction);\n- \nlarger air cooler fan can make a difference of 2-6 dB (A); number of blades, 6-8 instead\nof 4, makes a difference as well (also lowering the energy requirement);\n- \nuse of low noise fans with wider blades and lower tip speeds (< 40 m/s) for the same\nairflow and air pressure;\n• \nLow noise gear drives (small transmission ratios or multi-pole drive motors), helicoidal\ngears instead of right angle gears, belt drives and, if possible, direct drives.\n• \nBelt drive by V belt, flat belt or low noise moulded notch belts. If possible, belts should\nencapsulated;\n• \nLow noise fan motors;\n• \nCentrifugal instead of axial fans;\n• \nLargest possible distance between fan blades and support construction;\n• \nUse of flexible support of gears and fan motors;\n• \nAerodynamic design of the air passages.\nFurther reduction can be achieved by the way the equipment is operated. The number of\nrevolutions per minute can achieve further reduction of fan noise. In a period of lower demand\n(nighttime) fans could be operated at a lower rotation speed and a 50% reduction of speed can\nresult in a noise reduction of about 6-10 dB(A).\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.6.2.2.2 \nSecondary measures\nSecondary measures for mechanical draught cooling towers at air intake and discharge are\nbeneficial. Compared to the advantage of a sound reduction with 10 to 25 dB(A) a higher\npressure drop of 20 to 70 Pa must be accepted, which must be overcome by extra energy input\nor larger (noisier) fans.\nExamples are:\n• \nThe muffling of airflow and housing can contribute with a reduction of 5 dB(A).\n• \nSound absorbent construction crosses, which are built in the air outlet (diffuser) of smaller\nfan cooling towers, reduce the sound emission and also give a better flow line pattern and\nby this a better draft.\n• \nDroplet separators in wet cooling towers can be covered\n• \nIn addition mounds or walls (buildings or sound barriers) around the air intake opening have\nproven to be successful. The sound reduction by shielding can be up to 20 dB(A) in the\nvicinity of the cooling tower.\n3.6.2.3 Costs of noise reduction\nCosts of noise attenuation measures will vary considerably depending on the type of measure\nand whether it is part of the design of a new cooling installation or of a measure taken during\nretrofitting an installation. For a new installation of a hybrid tower, total costs of the noise\nattenuation measures (fan, baffles) accounted for about 20% of the total investment.\nAn example was reported with respect to costs showing how costs can increase with increasing\nreduction of noise. For an axial fan different designs (value C and tip speed) could be applied\nwithout reducing pressure drop and flow/fan efficiency. In case of very low and super low noise\nfans, additional measures to the drive are required at extra cost.\nTable 3.13: Example of cost increase with different fan design for reduced sound power level\nDerived from [tm086, Van der Spek, 1993]\nFan design\nSound power level\n(dB(A))\nPrice-index\nClassic\n\n\nLow noise\n\n 1.5\nVery low noise\n\n\nSuper low noise\n\n\nThe data in Table 3.13 just show cost differences for different fan designs, but costs for drive\ntransmissions, sound attenuation and cooling tower construction should also be taken into\naccount. The cost of primary measures such as super low noise fans may deliver at the same\ntime distinctly lower operating costs due to lower power requirements. It can therefore not be\nunambiguously concluded that the sound reduction level would not be cost-effective.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n3.7 Risk aspects associated with industrial cooling systems\n3.7.1 Risk of leakage\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\n3.7.1.1 Occurrence and consequences\nLeakage can occur both in water and air cooling systems, but generally leakage is a concern of\nwater cooled systems. In particular in once-through systems contamination will enter the aquatic\nenvironment immediately via the cooling water. In open and closed circuit wet and wet/dry\nsystems this will not happen immediately, but leakage will contaminate the coolant and the\nchemistry of the coolant will be disturbed with consequences for the heat exchanging process.\nThis effect of leakage on the working of oxidising and non-oxidising biocides has been clearly\nillustrated [tm090, Grab et al, 1994]. Finally, leaked process substances will be discharged with\nthe blowdown.\nIn direct air cooling systems leakage may lead to contamination of the cooling air, but generally\nleakage is not considered to be an environmental problem of dry air-cooling. This leaves the\nresponsibility of the operator unchanged to try and prevent leakage from dry cooling systems.\nCooling systems using refrigerants are not within the scope of this document.\nHeat exchangers are subject to corrosion, erosion and other forms of wear. Factors such as\nchoice of material, fluid speeds, wall temperature and pressure levels influence this. As a result\nof this, leakage of process fluids and contamination of the coolant or contamination/disturbance\nof the process can occur. The type of cooler can also be a potential influence on the risk of\nleakage. In practice, an operation that is different from the one intended by design causes\nvibrations, and ultimately, leakage. Leakage becomes a relevant problem when the flow to be\ncooled contains components that are harmful to the environment. Leakage from condensers at\npower stations or condensers of evaporating plants are not considered to be a problem from a\nwater quality viewpoint, but rather from a process-technical point of view. At power stations,\nleakage means a loss of vacuum in the condenser, which will lead to a loss of efficiency of the\npower generating process. With cooling in furnaces (steam generation) leakage of water can\nlead to explosions.\nProduct loss by leaching of heat exchangers can be important when, in a corrosive environment,\n(such as saltwater) relatively easily corroded material is used (for instance, copper condensers).\nCopper is often applied it reduces the chance of fouling, but in practice fouling is also found in\ncopper condensers. Copper emissions are undesirable and can be prevented with better materials\nsuch as titanium and stainless steel or by adding anti corrosion compounds.\nLeakage is also sometimes attributed to the 'sweating' of coolers. This concerns the presence of\nsmall hairline cracks or leaking of packing materials. The most common defects in heat\nexchangers, which are reported from actual practice, are caused by:\n• corrosion/erosion as a result of chemical pollution (pit corrosion),\n• corrosion resulting from biological foulings, chemicals, bacteria,\n• mechanical erosion (due to cracks or vibrating mussels),\n• vibrations (caused by flow or the resonance of external pumps, etc.),\n• leaking, defective packing materials,\n• sweating of 'rolled' tube-plate connections,\n• dislodged tube-plate attachments,\n• stress in materials as a result of incorrect operating pressure and/or temperature and\n• temperature gradient of cooler too high; over 50º C can cause problems.\nIn once-through systems using large volumes, small leaks are hard to detect. In the case of\ncooling systems that contain several heat exchangers, there might always be a number of\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\ndefective heat exchangers, creating a more or less constant level of pollution in the cooling\nwater, which is low and barely detectable in the large water flow. Larger levels of leakage can\nbe detected, but generally this also means a considerable and significant emission. In\nrecirculating systems with cooling towers, possible volatile compounds are stripped out and\nleakage is discharged in the blow down. In this case, because of the small volume of the\ndischarge flow, detection is easier and the blowdown can be treated if necessary.\nThe magnitude of leakage usually becomes known as a result of incidents and to a limited\nextent by measurement in once-through systems. Larger leaks are detected and are usually\nimmediately fairly significant. Data from actual cases have shown that levels of 100 to\n3000 kg/24 hours with exit flows in mg/l are easily possible with large effluents (10000 m3/hour\nand more). The frequency of failures for different types of heat exchangers shows wide\nvariation.\n3.7.1.2 Reduction of leakage\nHeat exchangers should be designed to prevent leakage. Different organisations have given\nrecommendations regarding the nature of maintenance. This consists of a combination of\npreventive and corrective maintenance, because with prevention alone it has been shown that\nproblems cannot be fully controlled. Preventive maintenance is often part of a production stop,\nonce every two years. With corrective maintenance, a cooler is turned off and leaks are repaired,\nfor instance by plugging a leaking tube or replacing a tube bank. For heat exchangers that\ncannot be turned off for production-technical reasons it is important that a second reserve cooler\nis available. It is becoming increasingly clear that \"failure\" and leaks are primarily caused by a\nfault in design. In the process industry, any extra costs of more expensive construction or better\nmaterials are usually easily outweighed by the costs of failure. Investment costs are low\ncompared to those entailed by a loss of production. The design of heat exchangers should\ntherefore take place on a basis of \"forecast availability\".\nThe following general measures to reduce the occurrence of leakage can be applied:\n• \nselect material for equipment of wet cooling systems according to the applied water quality;\n• \noperate the system according to its design;\n• \nif cooling water treatment is needed, select the right cooling water treatment program;\n• \nmonitor leakage in cooling water discharge in recirculating wet cooling systems\n(blowdown).\nIf problems arise in practice, there are a number of options, partially dependent on the cause:\nAt component level (the heat exchanger):\n• \ncheck causes of erosion, corrosion\n• \ncheck operating conditions vs. design conditions\n• \nreplace cooler by improved type, checking the construction and material\n• \ndrainage of flow polluted by leakage to purification (purification of sub-flow concerned)\n• \nrecirculation of cooling the water flow of the cooler concerned over either an air cooler,\nand/or indirect water cooling (this option naturally does not remedy production failure\nresulting from failure of the cooler).\nAt a system level (the complete cooling water system or parts thereof):\n• \nmaintain as small a pressure difference as possible between the cooling water and the\nprocess water, or create or maintain overpressure in the cooling water\n• \nconvert to an indirect system or if technically possible convert to a recirculating system with\ncooling tower (taking into account potential volatilisation of components).\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe VCI safety concept, applied by the chemical industry, refers to leakage as the temporary\ndischarge of substances causing long-term detrimental changes to water bodies. To prevent and\ncontrol this the chemical process substances are rated (using the R-phrases) and the final rating\nis linked to requirements concerning selection of the (indirect) cooling configuration system and\nthe way leakage is monitored (see Annex VII).\nIt is obvious that the application of an indirect completely system or a recirculating system with\na cooling tower can control leakage almost 100%. Only if system pressure drops can fouled\nwater be released, but this flow is small and controllable. Application of both options however,\nneeds awareness of the requirements of the process to be cooled. An indirect design or\napplication of a cooling tower will increase the approach and raise the minimum end\ntemperature of the process substance. If the process to be cooled can tolerate this, the\ncharacteristics of the process substance(s) may justify an indirect design to protect the receiving\nsurface water against any unwanted emission due to leakage.\nSome companies consciously use a cooling system in which parts that are subject to leakage are\nprovided with indirect cooling, and those that are not subject to leakage are not. As the control\nof leakage appears to be difficult, in cooling priority substances or other environmentally\nhazardous products, once-through systems should preferably not be used, especially in view of\nthe alternatives available.\nFor an existing cooling system an indirect design generally is neither technically nor\neconomically the most applicable solution. Practical experience with the application of a solid\nmaintenance and control programme to a large once-through cooling system using seawater has\ngiven good results. Some cooler replacements were necessary, but 90% of the failure of the\ndifferent heat exchangers could be reduced by proper antifouling treatment and operating care\n(vibration monitoring, pump handling and care with flow pinching). Leakage detection is\napplied and, by detecting at the right places, the time between heat exchanger leakage and\ndetection can be shortened.\nDetection of leakages in once-through systems is difficult, but a recommended starting point is\nthe identification of the heat exchangers that are prone to leakage and that cool harmful\nsubstances. More selective and accurate measurement of leakage will then be possible.\nPreventive and corrective maintenance are both important to overcome leakage problems, but\nproper design generally tends be most cost-effective.\n3.7.1.3 Reduction by preventive maintenance\nVisual inspection, hydrostatic testing and additional investigation on pulled tubes are examples\nof former inspection methods. The limitations of these methods were that the inspection was\nconcentrated on the directly visible parts of the tubes. Dirt often masks the early stages of\ndefects and uniform corrosion is hard to see with the naked eye. Hydrotesting only detects\nleaking tubes. The question is how to select a representative tube for further investigation. As a\nconsequence the former inspection methods described above could not prevent environmental\npollution due to unexpected leakage, breakdown, reduction in capacity and/or occurrence of off-\nspec product. On the other hand a great number of spare tubes had to be in stock for unexpected\nretubing.\nExperiences with a new kind of investigation of heat exchanger tubes (by means of eddy current\ninvestigation) have shown that the reliability of heat exchanger tubes can be increased\nsignificantly and that emissions due to leakage can be reduced. Because this method is capable\nof testing a single tube and giving a prediction of failure of a single tube, the inspection\nfrequency will be based on facts. As a consequence, inspection methods capable of predicting\nthe risk of failure of individual tubes of a heat exchanger can lead to a reduction of tube\nconsumption, better stock management and knowledge about corrosion behaviour in early\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nstages. This will lead to a reduction of unexpected breakdowns due to leaking tubes with the\nenvironmental benefit of a reduction of emissions via the cooling water.\nApplication of this method at the site of a chemical plant has resulted in a reduction of more\nthan 90 % of the percentage of retubing since introducing this method in 1990 [Paping, Dow\nChemical Benelux Terneuzen, 1999]. This has also resulted in a reduction in annual costs. The\naverage annual savings due to the reduction of number of pipes to be retubed are about 5 times\nas high as the inspection costs. The number of unexpected process breakdowns due to leaking\ntubes has been reduced by 90 % over the last 10 years.”\n3.7.2 Storage and handling of chemicals\nThe storage and handling of chemicals is potentially an environmental issue of wet cooling\nsystems. Dosage of cooling systems additives can be continuous or intermittent and the\nchemicals can be fed diluted or neat. The amounts of chemical and its characteristics vary\ngreatly and depend on a range of factors (e.g. water chemistry and heat exchanger material): the\nrisk due to storage and handling will vary accordingly.\nFor example, for pH control, concentrated sulphuric acid is used and this is usually stored in\nmild steel tanks. Proper ventilation is required to prevent the build-up of explosive hydrogen gas\nin the storage tank. Strainers upstream of acid pumps are advisable to remove any residual\ncorrosion products or other solids that may be present in the storage tank.\nSometimes additives are produced on-site. For example, hypochlorite can be produced on\nmarine sites by electrolysis of seawater. This process called electrochlorination can be\ndangerous for the potential of chlorinegas formation. Also, the installation needs frequent\ncleaning using acids. Alternative treatments are applied, where possible to avoid these risks (e.g.\nAnnex XI.3.4.7).\nCooling additives can be fed by the operator manually or by means of sophisticated computer\ncontrolled systems or can be outsourced to specialised firms, usually the actual supplier of the\nadditives. Feeding manually has a higher risk of spilling, and for environmental and human\nhealth reasons safe handling procedures should be applied. Automated systems run a risk of\nbeing neglected, but require regular inspection.\nIn the EU specific regulations on transport, storage or handling of chemicals have to be\nobserved and environmental permits require site-specific measures. Generally, the aim is to\nreduce the risk of spilling and leakage to prevent soil and/or ground water contamination and to\nreduce the risk of explosions by defining a restricted area where storage and handling of\nchemicals is allowed. Such areas are equipped with impermeable floors or grid floors with a\nbund, with segregation to keep reactive chemicals separate and with a minimum required\nventilation rate.\nBAT measures for the storage of dangerous substances are described in the BREF concerning\nemissions from storage.\n3.7.3 Microbiological risk\n3.7.3.1 Occurrence of microbes\nMicrobiological risks from cooling systems relate to the occurrence of different species of\npathogens in cooling water or in parts of the system that are in contact with the cooling water,\nsuch as biofilms in heat exchangers and fill in cooling towers. These risks are not an issue in dry\ncooling systems.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe major thermophilic pathogens that are found in wet cooling systems using river waters are\nthe bacteria Legionella pneumophila (Lp) and the amoeba Naegleria fowleri (Nf). In marine\nwaters some halophilic vibrios species, pathogenic for fish or man, can develop in once-through\ncooling systems. The species mentioned occur in the natural environment in generally low and\nharmless concentrations. Due to the raised temperature a favourable climate can occur in\ncooling systems enhancing the development of those bacteria, which can create a potential risk\nfor human health. Development of Legionella is enhanced by fouling, presence of amoeba,\nciliates and algae. It is spread through aerosols. Following some large outbreaks the occurrence\nand characteristics of Legionnaire’s disease (LD) and the development of Lp has been widely\nresearched from a medical/biological point of view. But many points relating to the chemical\nand process technology remain unclear.\nIn the plume of a natural draught wet cooling tower with a considerable height and with a good\nfunctioning drift eliminator, the emission of bacteria is of less importance, but not impossible. A\nhigh concentration of Lp in the plume of a natural draught wet cooling tower has been reported\ndue to fouling on the inside of the concrete cooling tower wall. The layer had been released\nfrom the wall and fallen onto the drift eliminator [tm145, Werner and Pietsch, 1991].\nThe appearance of Lp in the plume of industrial mechanical draught cooling towers, which have\na much lower height than natural draught towers, has been reported on a number of occasions\n[tm040, Schulze-Robbecke and Richter, 1994], but a clear cause and effect relation between\ncooling towers and an LD outbreak could not be established. Where a relation between cooling\nsystems and an outbreak of LD could be made it always concerned badly maintained systems\n[Morton et al., 1986].\nTypical conditions in wet cooling towers that enhance the development of Legionella are:\n• \nthe water temperature in the cooling tower is between 25 and 50 degrees centigrade;\n• \nthe pH between 6 and 8;\n• \nthe presence of fouling.\nLess information was submitted on the occurrence and treatment of other pathogens such as Nf.\nIt has been observed that development of Nf is inhibited by brass and enhanced by stainless\nsteel. The amoebae are also more abundant in open recirculating cooling systems than in once-\nthrough cooling systems. Research was carried out on the treatment of Nf after increased levels\nin plant cooling water (3000 1-1) followed replacement of condensers in a French power station.\nContinuous chlorination with a maximum free residual chlorine level in the range of 0.3-0.5\nmg/l decreased concentrations of Nf immediately and the levels remained under 4 pathogens/l.\n[tm 144, Cabanes et al, 1997].\n3.7.3.2 Measuring of bacteriae\nLp-bacteria are measured in colony forming units or CFU per litre and are reported to vary in\nconcentration in cooling tower water from very low (down to 10 CFU/l) to very high (105-106\nCFU/l). In biofilms Lp has been found in concentrations of up to 106 CFU/cm2.\nFor air conditioning systems, values of 100-1000 CFU are applied in the UK, but it is not clear\nif this can be compared to the levels in well-maintained wet cooling towers and the associated\nrisk in those situations. A recommendation was made to keep the concentration of Lp below 104\nCFU/l. Quantification of representative concentrations of Lp in industrial wet cooling systems\nand the level of CFU in wet cooling towers that is still acceptable with respect to human health\nmay require further research.\n3.7.3.3 Techniques to reduce microbiological risks\n([038, Millar et al., 1997] and [tm040, Schulze-Robbecke and Richter, 1994], [tm166, Morton et al,\n1986] [tm167, Fliermans, 1996], )\nThe chain of events to create an outbreak of Legionella involves:\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n- \nthe development of a virulent strain of bacteria in the cooling system\n- \nconditions that enhance the multiplication of bacteria\n- \ncontaminated water discharged to the atmosphere as aerosol\n- \nsufficient droplets deeply inhaled by susceptible persons\nPrevention of Legionella should therefore be based on prevention of development and\nmultiplication of bacteria in the cooling system. Particularly in the USA and UK\nrecommendations have been developed for prevention of LD. Regular analysis of the potential\nreservoir (e.g. cooling tower), and additional routine maintenance, proper pH and temperature\nlevels, adequate levels of residual biocides, and control on quality of the makeup water can\nprevent the occurrence of environments that encourage Legionella.\nOn the prevention of formation of Lp-bacteria (and others) in cooling towers, the following\nmeasures should be applied:\n• \nuse clean water and pretreat the cooling water if possible;\n• \navoid process leakage into the cooling system;\n• \navoid stagnant zones;\n• \nprevent formation by reduction of light energy within the cooling tower avoiding algae\nformation; open water basins are to be avoided;\n• \neasy access for regular cleaning should be provided;\n• \nuse of drift eliminators that can be easily cleaned or replaced;\n• \ndesign cold water temperature as low as possible (small approaches);\n• \navoid scale and corrosion;\n• \noptimisation of construction to enhance the right water velocity and air speed;\n• \na minimum distance of the CT from populated areas is impossible to give, but consideration\nshould be given to avoiding the plume reaching ground level or reaching populated areas, if\nspace allows;\n• \nminimisation of plume formation could restrict the spread.\nWith respect to the location of a cooling tower a rating has been suggested of the\nmicrobiological risk associated with a cooling tower based on the host population and the\npotential susceptibility of the host. The rating categories are:\n- \nCategory 1: highest risk – cooling tower serving or in the vicinity (<200 m) of a hospital,\nnursing home or other health care facility caring for persons who may be immunologically\ncompromised;\n- \nCategory 2: cooling tower serving or in the vicinity (>200 m) of a retirement community,\nhotel or other buildings accommodating a large number of people are localised;\n- \nCategory 3: cooling tower in a residential or industrial neighbourhood;\n- \nCategory 4: lowest risk – cooling tower isolated from residential neighbourhood (>600 m\nfrom residential area).\nBased on this rating, inspection for the presence of Legionella ranges from monthly (highest\nrisk), monthly to quarterly (Cat. 2), quarterly to yearly (Cat. 3) to once a year after summer\n(Cat. 4).\nThe following measures are recommended to operators of cooling towers:\n• \ncare must be taken in case of process stops and start-ups, especially if the cooling\ncirculation system is down for more than 4 days;\n• \noperators entering cooling towers should avoid inhaling the air by using mouth and nose\nprotection (P3-mask has been proven);\n• \nIf cleaning a cooling system after Lp has been detected, a combination of mechanical\ncleaning and a shock-dosage of a biocide.\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nSome additional remarks on these recommendations can be made. After a prolonged shutdown\nit is imperative to treat cooling systems with a biocide (chlorine). If there is evidence of a dirty\nor contaminated system, including accessories such as sound attenuation, it must be cleaned and\nreceive biocide shock treatment prior to start-up. A competent water treatment company should\nconduct such treatment. Disinfection of the system may be needed if the system is heavily\ncontaminated.\nFrom experience it is clear that chemical treatment mainly treats the bacteria in the water. To\ncontrol and clean the cooling system more thoroughly attention must be paid to sediments and\nfouling on the cooling system surface, hence the importance of mechanical cleaning.\nThe level of free chlorine of 50 mg/l mentioned in the literature is clearly a shock dosage level\nthat has been applied after an outbreak of LD. Because of the large amount of hypochlorite\ninvolved, it is clear that this treatment is not appropriate as maintenance level in a cooling\ntower. In any case, after shock dosing, detoxification of the treated cooling water would be\nnecessary before discharge and treatment with bisulphite has been commonly applied.\nA high maintenance level to prevent Lp-development as much as possible is to be favoured. In\ngeneral, oxidising biocides are favoured for killing the Legionella in the water. Slower acting\nagents are needed to attack bacteria in the biofilms. This would then require treatment with non-\noxidising biocides. Of these the QACs have shown better results than the isothiozolines.\nIn a recent Dutch report [tm155, Berbee, 1999] some results on reducing the CFU-level in\ncooling towers were reported which confirmed that a clear minimum concentration level of\nbiocides has not yet determined. It was concluded that high levels of biocide were needed to\nreduce-concentrations, but only showed a temporary effect. The side effect of elevated levels of\ntoxic by-products must be realised. Lower water temperature appeared to be more effective than\napplication of biocides (Table 3.14), but this may not be applicable in every case. Investigations\ninto the effect of treatment of the protozoa revealed that very high concentrations are needed to\nkill the protozoa and that cysts are hardly susceptible to the applied non-oxidising biocides.\nTable 3.14: Effects of temperature and biocide treatment on CFU-levels in cooling towers\nQuoted from Kusnetsov by [tm155, Berbee, 1999]\nCooling tower\nEffect of lower\nTemp\nBiocide conc.\n(mg/l)\nEffect of biocide\nRemarks\nA\nT 25ºC~105 CFU\nto\nT 15ºC~103 CFU\nPHMB, 3, shock\nTemporarily \nunder\ndetection limit\nB\nT 25ºC~104 CFU\nTo\nT 15ºC~103 CFU\nBNPD, 5, shock\nTemporarily \nunder\ndetection limit\nC\nn.r.\nPHMB, 2-250,\nShock\nNot clear\nChange to tapwater\nD\nn.r.\nPHMB, 4-11,\nShock\nTemporarily,\n104 CFU/l to\n103 CFU/l\nE\nn.r.\nBNPD, 65-190,\nshock\nTemporarily,\n105 CFU/l to\n103 CFU/l\nNotes:\nPHMB: polyhexamethylenebiguanidechloride (QAC)\nBNPD: bromonitropropaandiol\n\nChapter 3\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n3.8 Waste from cooling system operation\nLittle has been reported on the wastes or residues from cooling systems operation. For all\ncooling systems, decommissioning of part or all of system can be an issue at some stage.\nRetrofitting and replacement of equipment as well as the operating methods result in the\nfollowing wastes to be disposed of:\n• \nsludge from pre-treatment of intake water (e.g. decarbonisation), treatment of cooling water\nor blowdown from the operation of recirculating wet cooling towers (see Annex XI 3.4);\n• \nhazardous waste (e.g. small containers, spillage) associated with the chemical treatment of\ncooling water in wet cooling systems;\n• \nwaste water of cleaning operations;\n• \nwastes as a result of retrofitting, replacing or decommissioning of the installation.\n3.8.1 Formation of sludges\nSludge formation can occur in the collecting basins of wet cooling systems. In quantitive terms,\nmore sludge results from the decarbonisation process, if this is practised on site. No particular\nmeasures have been reported on reducing the formation of sludge. Appropriate cooling water\nconditioning is likely to reduce settlement of sludge. Currently, chemical composition of the\nsludge and the local (or national) legislation will determine the disposal method for sludges. In\nsome Member States sludges can be returned to the surface water of origin, but in others they\nhave to be treated in more strictly defined ways.\nSludges and mud deposited on the bottom of water basins of cooling towers can contain cysts or\nresistance forms of pathogenic bacteria and protozoa (3.7.3). Pathogenic amoebae and\nLegionella pneumophila are found at very high concentrations in sludge collected from\ncondenser tubes during downtime or in clarifying iron chloride sludge [tm145, Werner and\nPietsch, 1991]. Cysts of Lp are also found in the scale on the fill. As a consequence it is\nrecommended that the microbiological quality of this type of residue be surveyed prior to the\ndisposal or the reprocessing of PVC fills. A special treatment may be required if the handling\nand reprocessing of these wastes cause a significant health risk.\n3.8.2 Residues from cooling water treatment and cleaning operations\nTreatment of cooling water (especially for larger systems) nowadays is automatic and in many\ncases the substances are kept in containers and tanks and are applied stored, transported and\nhandled by the supplier.\nThe same applies to waste water resulting from cleaning operations. Here too, more and more\nspecialised companies are contracted to do this work.\nThe generation and disposal of this type of waste however is not typical for industrial cooling\nsystems. The extent to which it represents an environmental problem is closely related to the\nway in which the cooling system is operated, to pre-treatment of the intake water and to the\nefficiency of the cooling water treatment. No information has been submitted on this\nenvironmental issue.\n3.8.3 Residues as a result of retrofitting, replacing and decommissioning\nof the installation\nGenerally, cooling systems are designed and built for a long service life (up to 20 years and\nmore). Obviously, the better the way they are operated and maintained the longer their\noperational life, but they should also be designed and built for the particular circumstances in\nwhich they are to be used. Particular materials should also be considered for their environmental\n\nChapter 3\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nimpact when applying, decommissioning or replacing parts of a cooling system. The following\nexamples were reported.\n3.8.3.1 Use of plastics\nIncreasingly, different kind of plastics are applied for cooling tower construction, such as\npolyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyethylene and glass reinforced plastics. Their\ncharacteristics make them highly suitable for application in the often corrosive, highly\ndemanding environment of a cooling tower. Current experiences have been described in a\ntechnical paper of the German Organisation of Power Plant Operators [tm.., VGB, 2000]. The\nuse of plastics may be an opportunity for waste reduction, if there is a possibility of recycling\nafter replacement of plastic elements. No experiences have yet been reported that could\nillustrate this.\n3.8.3.2 Treatment of timber used for wet cooling tower construction\nTimber has been and is used for cooling towers, but has to be treated to ensure its longevity.\nTimber used in cooling towers for both packing and support structures can be chemically\ntreated. Treatment has been and still can be based on CCA (copper sulphate, potassium\ndichromate and arsenic pentoxide), because of its ability to remain bound to the timber. It is\nclaimed that over its operating life only 10% by weight is lost.\nQuantification of the extent to which emissions from CCA-treated timber occur into the aquatic\nenvironment cannot be quoted. It has been reported that treated timber, although it has time to\ndrain, still has considerable amounts of chemicals on the wood surface. They may be washed off\nin the initial flush of water in the cooling tower and will be sooner or later be discharged into\nthe receiving water.\nBecause CCA contains Cr and As, it seems unlikely that will continue to be used for much\nlonger. CCA treatment of timber is not a best available technique and is expected to be banned.\nAlternative treatments for protection of timber have already been developed and applied. It is\ntherefore expected that emissions into the surface water resulting from CCA will gradually\nreduce.\nIf CCA-treated wood has to be disposed of - some countries allow controlled disposal in an\nappropriate landfill site - as low leaching is expected. In other Member States incineration in an\nappropriate installation is preferred, where most of the elements will be retained in the dustfilter.\nDetermining the most favourable technique for dispose of the CCA-treated timber is beyond the\nscope of this BREF-document, but also here the final environmental impact of the different\noptions needs to be evaluated here.\n3.8.3.3 Wet cooling tower fill\nAs soon as cooling tower fill needs to be replaced it will have to be disposed of. Fills are made\nof different materials and this will determine the way in which they will have to be treated. No\ndata on polluting levels of fill have been reported.\nA special case is the use of asbestos paper fill. It has not been possible to assess whether this has\nbeen practised in Europe, but asbestos may have been used in many applications in the past,\nincluding cooling tower construction or cooling tower fill. As the hazards of the use of asbestos\nare no longer in doubt, it is no longer used in cooling towers. In old cooling towers some\nasbestos may still be found and special measures are required to remove it.\nOne reference reported an example in which crumbling of asbestos fill occurred over a period of\n10-17 years of operation, causing reduced heat exchange. Removal and replacement of the fill\nwere necessary under severe safety conditions [tm082, Mittendorf, 1990].\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n4 BEST \nAVAILABLE \nTECHNIQUES \nFOR \nINDUSTRIAL\nCOOLING SYSTEMS\n4.1 Introduction\nIn understanding this chapter and its contents, the attention of the reader is drawn back to the\npreface of this document and in particular the fifth section of the preface: “How to understand\nand use this document”. The techniques and methods and associated emission and/or\nconsumption levels, or ranges of levels, presented in this chapter have been assessed through an\niterative process involving the following steps:\n• \nidentification of the key environmental issues for the process; emphasis in the process of\ncooling is clearly on energy efficiency increase (increase of the overall energy efficiency of\nthe process), on the reduction of emissions to surface water by optimization of cooling\nwater conditioning;\n• \nexamination of the techniques most relevant to address those key issues;\n• \nidentification of the best environmental performance levels, on the basis of the available\ndata in the European Union and world-wide; in most cases performance levels are\nconsidered as installation specific.\n• \nexamination of the conditions under which these performance levels were achieved; such as\ncosts, cross-media effects, main driving forces involved in implementation of this\ntechniques; generally, price indications of techniques in cooling systems have been reported\nto a very limited extent;\n• \nselection of the best available techniques (BAT) and the associated emission and/or\nconsumption levels for this sector in a general sense all according to Article 2(11) and\nAnnex IV of the Directive.\nExpert judgement by the European IPPC Bureau and the relevant Technical Working Group\n(TWG) has played a key role in each of these steps and in the way in which the information is\npresented here.\nOn the basis of this assessment, techniques, and as far as possible emission and consumption\nlevels associated with the use of BAT, are presented in this chapter that are considered to be\nappropriate to the relevant cooling systems and in many cases reflect current performance of\nsome installations applied. Where emission or consumption levels “associated with best\navailable techniques” are presented, this is to be understood as meaning that those levels\nrepresent the environmental performance that could be anticipated as a result of the application,\nunder the process and site-specific conditions, of the techniques described, bearing in mind the\nbalance of costs and advantages inherent within the definition of BAT. However, they are\nneither emission nor consumption limit values nor minimum required performance levels and\nshould not be understood as such. In some cases it may be technically possible to achieve better\nemission or consumption levels, but due to the costs involved or cross-media considerations\nthey are not considered to be appropriate as a BAT for the relevant cooling configuration.\nHowever, such levels or applications may be considered to be justified in more specific cases\nwhere there are special driving forces.\nThe emission and consumption levels associated with the application of BAT have to be seen\ntogether with any specified reference condition (e.g. climate, site limitations).\nThe concept of “levels associated with BAT” described above is to be distinguished from the\nterm “achievable level” used elsewhere in this document. Where a level is described as\n“achievable” using a particular technique or combination of techniques, this should be\nunderstood to mean that the level may be expected to be achieved over a substantial period of\ntime in a well maintained and operated installation or process using those techniques.\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nWhere available, data concerning costs have been given together with the description of the\ntechniques presented in the previous chapter or the Annexes. These give a rough indication\nabout the magnitude of costs involved. However, the actual cost of applying a technique will\ndepend strongly on the specific situation regarding, for example, taxes, fees, and the technical\ncharacteristics of the installation concerned. It is not possible to evaluate such site-specific\nfactors fully in this document. In the absence of data concerning costs, conclusions on economic\nviability of techniques are drawn from observations on existing installations.\nIt is intended that the general BAT in this chapter are a reference point against which to judge\nthe current performance of an existing installation or to judge a proposal for a new installation.\nIn this way they will assist in the determination of appropriate \"BAT-based\" conditions for the\ninstallation or in the establishment of general binding rules under Article 9(8). It is foreseen that\nnew installations can be designed to perform at or even better than the general BAT levels\npresented here. It is also considered that existing installations could move towards the general\nBAT levels or do better, subject to the technical and economic applicability of the techniques in\neach case.\nWhile the BREFs do not set legally binding standards, they are meant to give information for\nthe guidance of industry, Member States and the public on achievable emission and\nconsumption levels when using specified techniques. The appropriate limit values for any\nspecific case will need to be determined taking into account the objectives of the IPPC Directive\nand the local considerations.\n4.2 A horizontal approach to defining BAT for cooling systems\nBefore summarising the BAT conclusions in this chapter, a short explanation is given on how\nthe horizontal character of this BREF should be interpreted.\nIn a horizontal approach it is assumed that the environmental aspects of the applied techniques\nand the associated reduction measures can be assessed and that generic BAT can be identified\nthat are independent of the industrial processes in which techniques are applied.\nIndustrial cooling systems are an integrated part of the industrial process to be cooled. The\ncooling systems within the scope of this document are used in many of the industrial sectors\nunder the scope of IPPC. Consequently, the variety of applications, techniques and operational\npractices is enormous. Additionally, the thermodynamic character of the process leads to further\nvariations in performance and consequently in the environmental effects.\nDue to this large variation, comparisons between techniques leading to general conclusions on\nBAT are difficult. The identification of a general preventive approach is considered to be\npossible, based on practical experience with reduction of emissions from cooling systems.\nIn this preventive approach or, primary BAT-approach, attention is firstly given to the process\nto be cooled. The design and the construction of the cooling system are an essential second step,\nin particular for new installations. Finally, changes of equipment and the way in which the\ncooling system should be operated will address new installations, but are particularly important\nin existing systems, where technological options are considerably limited and cost-intensive.\nCareful evaluations must be performed case by case.\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n4.2.1 Integrated heat management\n4.2.1.1 Industrial cooling = Heat management\nCooling of industrial processes can be considered as heat management and is part of the total\nenergy management within a plant. The amount and level of heat to be dissipated requires a\ncertain level of cooling systems performance. This performance level will in turn affect the\nsystem configuration, design and operation and consequently the cooling systems’\nenvironmental performance (direct impact). Reversibly, the cooling performance will also affect\nthe overall efficiency of the industrial process (indirect impact). Both impacts, direct and\nindirect, need to be balanced, taking into account all variables. Every change in the cooling\nsystem has to be considered against the consequences it may have for this balance.\nThis concept can be used as a starting point to formulate the first principle of BAT for cooling\nsystems. BAT for all installations is an integrated approach to reduce the environmental impact\nof industrial cooling systems maintaining the balance between both the direct and indirect\nimpacts. In other words, the effect of an emission reduction has to be balanced against the\npotential change in the overall energy efficiency. There is currently no minimum ratio in terms\nof the environmental benefits and the possible loss in overall energy efficiency that can be used\nas a benchmark to arrive at techniques that can be considered BAT. Nevertheless, this concept\ncan be used to compare alternatives (Chapter 3.2 and Annex II).\n4.2.1.2 Reduction of the level of heat discharge by optimization of\ninternal/external heat reuse\nA preventive approach should start with the industrial process requiring heat dissipation and aim\nto reduce the need for heat discharge in the first place. In fact, discharge of heat is wasting\nenergy and as such not BAT. Reuse of heat within the process should always be a first step in\nthe evaluation of cooling needs. Process-integrated energy measures are outside the scope of\nthis document, but reference is made to other BAT Reference Documents drafted in the\nframework of IPPC describing options for energy measures.\nIn a greenfield situation, assessment of the required heat capacity can only be BAT if it is the\noutcome of maximum use of the internal and external available and applicable options for\nreuse of excess heat.\nIn an existing installation, optimizing internal and external reuse and reducing the amount\nand level of heat to be discharged must also precede any change to the potential capacity of the\napplied cooling system. Increasing the efficiency of an existing cooling system by improving\nsystems operation must be evaluated against an increase of efficiency by technological\nmeasures through retrofit or technological change. In general and for large existing cooling\nsystems, the improvement of the systems operation is considered to be more cost effective than\nthe application of new or improved technology and can therefore be regarded as BAT.\n4.2.1.3 Cooling system and process requirements\nOnce the level and amount of waste heat generated by the process is established and no further\nreduction of waste heat can be achieved, an initial selection of a cooling system can be made in\nthe light of the process requirements discussed in Chapter 1. Every process has its unique\ncombination of requirements, where the level of control of the process, process reliability and\nsafety play an important role. This makes it almost impossible at this stage to make a first\ncharacterisation of BAT, but the following conclusions can be drawn with respect to a number\nof process characteristics.\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe application of the ambient temperature levels is based on the experiences in Europe in\napplying cooling systems under different climatic conditions. Generally, dry bulb temperatures\ndo not justify cooling away low level waste, heat and water-cooling is preferred. But in areas\nwith low average dry bulb temperatures dry air-cooling is applied to cool down to lower process\ntemperatures (after options for reuse have been explored). Water-cooling, if sufficient water is\navailable, can then dissipate the residual amount of waste heat.\nHazardous process substances, which involve a high environmental risk to the aquatic\nenvironment in case of leakage, should be cooled by means of indirect cooling systems to\nprevent an uncontrollable situation.\nThe selection of a cooling configuration should be based on a comparison between the different\nfeasible alternatives within all requirements of the process. Process requirements are for\nexample control of chemical reactions, reliability of process performance and maintenance of\nrequired safety levels. The aim is to minimise the indirect impact of the selected alternative. For\neach alternative the environmental performances can be best compared if expressed in direct\nand indirect use of energy (kWe) per unit of energy discharged (kWth). Another way to compare\nconfigurations is to express the change in direct energy use (kWe) of the cooling system and the\nchange in production level of the process in tonnes, both per unit of energy discharged (kWth).\nA change in cooling technology to reduce the environmental impact can only be considered\nBAT if the efficiency of cooling is maintained at the same level or, even better, at an increased\nlevel.\nTable 4.1: Examples of process requirements and BAT\nProcess\ncharacteristics\nCriteria\nPrimary BAT\napproach\nRemark\nReference\nLevel of dissipated heat\nhigh (> 60ºC)\nReduce use of water\nand chemicals and\nimprove overall\nenergy efficiency\n(Pre-) cooling\nwith dry air\nEnergy efficiency\nand size of cooling\nsystem are limiting\nfactors\nSection\n1.1/1.3\nLevel of dissipated heat\nmedium (25-60ºC)\nImprove overall\nenergy efficiency\nNot evident\nSite-specific\nSection\n1.1/1.3\nLevel of dissipated heat\nlow (<25ºC)\nImprove overall\nenergy efficiency\nWater cooling\nSite selection\nSection\n1.1/1.3\nLow and medium heat\nlevel and capacity\nOptimum overall\nenergy efficiency\nwith water saving\nand visible plume\nreduction\nWet and hybrid\ncooling system\nDry cooling less\nsuitable due to\nrequired space and\nloss of overall\nenergy efficiency\nSection 1.4\nHazardous substances\nto be cooled involving\nhigh environmental risk\nReduction of risk of\nleakage\nIndirect cooling\nsystem\nAccept an increase\nin approach\nSection 1.4\nand\nAnnex VI\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n4.2.1.4 Cooling system and site requirements\nThe site-imposed limits apply particularly to new installations, where a cooling system must still\nbe selected. If the required heat discharge capacity is known it may influence the selection of an\nappropriate site. For temperature-sensitive processes it is BAT to select the site with the\nrequired availability of cooling water.\nFor many reasons new installations are not always erected on a site that is preferred from a\ncooling technology point of view, whereas for both new and existing installations the site\ncharacteristics are clear once the site is known. The most important thermodynamic\ncharacteristic of a site is its annual climatic pattern described by the dry and wet bulb\ntemperatures.\nTable 4.2: Examples of site characteristics and BAT\nCharacteristics\nof site\nCriteria\nPrimary BAT\napproach\nRemarks\nReference\nClimate\nRequired design\ntemperature\nAssess variation in wet\nand dry bulb T\nWith high dry bulb\nT dry air cooling\ngenerally has lower\nEnergy efficiency\nSection\n1.4.3\nSpace\nRestricted\nsurface on-site\n(Pre-assembled) Roof\ntype constructions\nLimits to size and\nweight of the\ncooling system\nSection\n1.4.2\nSurface water\navailability\nRestricted\navailability\nRecirculating systems\nWet, dry or hybrid\nfeasible\nSection 2.3\nand 3.3\nSensitivity of\nreceiving water\nbody for thermal\nloads\nMeet capacity to\naccommodate\nthermal load\n- \nOptimise level of\nheat reuse\n- \nUse recirculating\nsystems\n- \nSite selection (new\ncooling system)\nSection 1.1\nRestricted\navailability of\ngroundwater\nMinimisation of\ngroundwater use\nAir cooling if no\nadequate alternative\nwater source is available\nAccept energy\npenalty\nSection 3.3\nCoastal area\nLarge capacity\n> 10 MWth\nOnce-through systems\nAvoid mixing of\nlocal thermal\nplume near intake\npoint, e.g. by deep\nwater extraction\nbelow mixing zone\nusing temperature\nstratification\nSection\n1.2.1 /\nSection 3.2\n/Annex XI.3\nSpecific site\nrequirements\nIn case of\nobligation\nforplume\nreduction and\nreduced tower\nheight\nApply hybrid cooling\nsystem\nAccept energy\npenalty\nCh.2\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nOther characteristics identified are space, water availability to cool and to discharge and the\nsurrounding sensitive areas (urban and industrial). With respect to groundwater, it can be BAT\nto apply a dry cooling system following the principle to minimise the use of groundwater,\nparticularly in those areas where depletion of aquifers cannot be ruled out.\nIn Table 4.2 BAT examples are shown that have been identified for a few site characteristics.\n4.2.2 Application of BAT in industrial cooling systems\nIn Chapter 1 the outline of a preventive approach is presented showing how a step-by-step\nevaluation of all constraints can lead to what may be called “Best available cooling technique”.\nWithin the framework of this approach, Chapter 1 and Chapter 3 and the associated Annexes\ndiscuss the factors and offer techniques involved in the identification of potential BAT for the\nmajor cooling configurations using water and/or air. The optimization of a cooling system to\nreduce its environmental impact is a complex exercise and not an exact mathematical\ncomparison. In other words, combining techniques selected from the BAT-tables does not lead\nto a BAT cooling system. The final BAT solution will be a site-specific solution. However, it\nis believed that, based on experience in industry, conclusions can be drawn on BAT, in\nquantified terms where possible.\nIn Chapter 3 options for reducing emissions into the environment have been presented based on\nthe information submitted by the TWG. For each environmental issue and for each relevant\ncooling configuration an attempt has been made to identify a general approach and arrive at\nBAT. Some techniques are described in more detail in the Annexes. Emphasis is clearly on the\nwater-related problems with a focus on reduction of the application of biocides and blacklisted\nsubstances.\nThe proposed techniques are applied techniques. They have proven to be effective, although\nquantification is difficult and they may create unrealistic expectations. It can be assumed that all\nmeasures proposed as BAT, and which are not entirely dependant on the local situation, can be\nconsidered for new systems. With respect to existing installations, care must be taken as the\nassessment is more difficult where options are limited and depend on a multitude of (process)\nfactors. There do not seem to be many obstacles to implementation of operational measures in\nexisting cooling systems, unless the technological design limits the number of options for\nmodification.\nIn Tables 4.3 to 4.12 techniques are presented that are considered BAT, following on from the\nprimary BAT-approach for:\n• \nincreasing the overall energy efficiency,\n• \nreduction of use of water and of cooling water additives,\n• \nreduction of emissions to air and water,\n• \nreduction of noise,\n• \nreduction of entrainment of aquatic organisms and\n• \nreduction of biological risks.\nNo clear BAT has been identified on the reduction of waste or techniques to handle waste\navoiding environmental problems, such as contamination of soil and water, or air in the case of\nincineration.\nFor each environmental issue the consequences for other media of the application of a reduction\ntechnique have been identified. Generally speaking every change made to a cooling system must\nbe carefully balanced against the associated effects and in this sense the optimisation of\nindustrial cooling is a cross-media issue.\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFor some measures BAT-values have been identified. However, addressing the application of\ndifferent cooling techniques in a multitude of varying process conditions does not allow for\nclear associated levels. In those cases a qualitative description is given.\nFor new cooling installations it is BAT to start identifying reduction measures in the design\nphase, applying equipment with low energy requiring requirement and by choosing the\nappropriate material for equipment in contact with the process substance and/or the cooling\nwater. In this sense the following quotation is exemplary: “in practice… attention to design,\nlayout and maintenance of the cooling water system has a relatively low priority compared to\nthe environmental consequences of a poorly designed and/or operated cooling water system.\nSince little attention is paid to design factors, treatments often have to make up for bad design,\nand therefore need to be chosen in such a way that they minimize risks of fouling. Few changes\nof this attitude are to be expected as long as there is a low level of awareness of the long-term\ncosts of operating and maintaining poorly designed CWS” [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner,\n1996].\nIf dry air cooling systems are the preferred option, measures are primarily related to reduction of\ndirect energy consumption and noise emissions and the optimization of size with respect to the\nrequired cooling surface.\nFor existing installations, technological measures can be BAT under certain circumstances.\nGenerally, a change in technology is cost-intensive where overall efficiency must be\nmaintained. Cost evaluation should then compare investment costs of the change versus the\nchange in operational costs and validate the reduction effect versus other environmental\nconsequences. For example, it would need a comparison between the environmental effect of\nrecirculating the cooling water - requiring the application of biocidal water treatment - against a\nonce-through system without biocides, but a large heat emission to the aquatic environment.\nIn the case of pre-assembled off-the-peg cooling towers, a change in technology seems feasible\nboth technically and economically. No comparable data have been submitted that can support\nthis, but supplier experience is that it is relatively easy to change small size cooling towers, for\nexample, from a closed recirculating wet to a closed recirculating hybrid or wet/dry\nconfiguration. This would not need major process modifications or constructionwork.\nFor large custom-designed towers that are erected on-site, technological changes are not easy to\nmake. A different technology generally means a completely new cooling tower.\nFor existing wet cooling systems, where the focus is largely on environmental measures to\nreduce water use and to emissions of chemicals to the surface water, BAT has not so much\ntechnological but rather an operational character. Monitoring, operation and maintenance are the\nkey issues here.\n4.3 Reduction of energy consumption\n4.3.1 General\nIt is BAT in the design phase of a cooling system:\n• \nTo reduce resistance to water and airflow\n• \nTo apply high efficiency/low energy equipment\n• \nTo reduce the amount of energy demanding equipment (Annex XI.8.1)\n• \nTo apply optimised cooling water treatment in once-through systems and wet cooling\ntowers to keep surfaces clean and avoid scaling, fouling and corrosion.\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nFor each individual case a combination of the above-mentioned factors should lead to the lowest\nattainable energy consumption to operate a cooling system. Concerning BAT a number of\ntechniques/approaches have been identified.\n4.3.2 Identified reduction techniques within the BAT-approach\nIn an integrated approach to cooling an industrial process, both the direct and indirect use of\nenergy are taken into account. In terms of the overall energy efficiency of an installation, the use\nof a once-through systems is BAT, in particular for processes requiring large cooling capacities\n(e.g. > 10 MWth). In the case of rivers and/or estuaries once-through can be acceptable if also:\n• \nextension of heat plume in the surface water leaves passage for fish migration;\n• \ncooling water intake is designed aiming at reduced fish entrainment;\n• \nheat load does not interfere with other users of receiving surface water.\nFor power stations, if once-through is not possible, natural draught wet cooling towers are most\nenergy-efficient than other cooling configurations, but application can be restricted because of\nthe visual impact of their overall height.\nTable 4.3: BAT for increasing overall energy efficiency\nRelevance\nCriterion\nPrimary BAT approach\nRemarks\nReference\nLarge cooling\ncapacity\nOverall energy\nefficiency\nSelect site for once-through\noption\nSee text above\ntable\nSection\n3.2\nAll systems\nOverall energy\nefficiency\nApply option for variable\noperation\nIdentify required\ncooling range\nSection\n1.4\nAll systems\nVariable\noperation\nModulation of air/ water\nflow\nAvoid instability\ncavitation in\nsystem (corrosion\nand erosion)\nAll wet systems\nClean circuit/\nexchanger\nsurfaces\nOptimised water treatment\nand pipe surface treatment\nRequires adequate\nmonitoring\nSection\n3.4\nOnce-through\nsystems\nMaintain\ncooling\nefficiency\nAvoid recirculation of warm\nwater plume in rivers and\nminimise it in estuaries and\non marine sites\nAnnex XII\nAll cooling\ntowers\nReduce specific\nenergy\nconsumption\nApply pumping heads and\nfans with reduced energy\nconsumption\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n4.4 Reduction of water requirements\n4.4.1 General\nFor new systems the following statements can be made:\n• \nIn the light of the overall energy balance, cooling with water is most efficient;\n• \nFor new installations a site should be selected for the availability of sufficient quantities of\n(surface) water in the case of large cooling water demand;\n• \nThe cooling demand should be reduced by optimising heat reuse;\n• \nFor new installations a site should be selected for the availability of an adequate receiving\nwater, particularly in case of large cooling water discharges;\n• \nWhere water availability is limited, a technology should be chosen that enables different\nmodes of operation requiring less water for achieving the required cooling capacity at all\ntimes;\n• \nIn all cases recirculating cooling is an option, but this needs careful balancing with other\nfactors, such as the required water conditioning and a lower overall Energy efficiency.\nFor existing water cooling systems, increasing heat reuse and improving operation of the system\ncan reduce the required amount of cooling water. In the case of rivers with limited availability\nof surface water, a change from a once-through system to a recirculating cooling systems is a\ntechnological option and may be considered BAT.\nFor power stations with large cooling capacities, this is generally considered as a cost-intensive\nexercise requiring a new construction. Space requirements must be taken into account.\n4.4.2 Identified reduction techniques within the BAT-approach\nTable 4.4: BAT for reduction of water requirements\nRelevance\nCriterion\nPrimary BAT\napproach\nRemarks\nRef.\nReduction of need for\ncooling\nOptimisation of heat\nreuse\nCh.1\nReduction of use of limited\nsources\nUse of groundwater is\nnot BAT\nSite-specific in\nparticular for\nexisting systems\nCh.2\nReduction of water use\nApply recirculating\nsystems\nDifferent demand on\nwater conditioning\nCh.2/3.3\nReduction of water use,\nwhere obligation for plume\nreduction and reduced\ntower height\nApply hybrid cooling\nsystem\nAccept energy\npenalty\nCh.2.6/\n3.3.1.2\nAll wet cooling\nsystems\nWhere water (make-up\nwater) is not available\nduring (part of) process\nperiod or very limited\n(drought-stricken areas)\nApply dry cooling\nAccept energy\npenalty\nSection 3.2\nand 3.3\nAnnex\nXII.6\nAll\nrecirculating\nwet and wet/dry\ncooling systems\nReduction of water use\nOptimization of cycles\nof concentration\nIncreased demand\non conditioning of\nwater, such as use of\nsoftened make-up\nwater\nSection 3.2\nand section\nXI\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nApplication of dry air-cooling has been suggested on a number of occasions. If the overall\nEnergy efficiency is taken into account, dry air-cooling is less attractive than wet cooling. With\nthis the dry technology is not disqualified. For shorter lifetime periods it was calculated that the\ndifferences in costs between dry and wet become less than for longer lifetime periods. When\ncosts for water and water treatment are taken into account, differences also become smaller. Dry\ncooling can be recommended in certain circumstances and for precooling at higher temperature\nlevels, where excessive water would be needed.\n4.5 Reduction of entrainment of organisms\n4.5.1 General\nThe adaptation of water intake devices to lower the entrainment of fish and other organisms is\nhighly complex and site-specific. Changes to an existing water intake are possible but costly.\nFrom the applied or tested fish protection or repulsive technologies, no particular techniques can\nyet be identified as BAT. The local situation will determine which fish protection or repulsive\ntechnique will be BAT. Some general applied strategies in design and position of the intake can\nbe considered as BAT, but these are particularly valid for new systems.\nOn the application of sieves it should be noted that costs of disposal of the resulting organic\nwaste collected from the sieves can be considerable.\n4.5.2 Identified reduction techniques within the BAT-approach\nTable 4.5: BAT for reduction of entrainment\nRelevance\nCriterion\nPrimary BAT approach\nRemarks\nRef.\nAppropriate position\nand design of intake\nand selection of\nprotection technique\nAnalysis of the biotope in\nsurface water source\nAlso critical areas,\nsuch as spawning\ngrounds, migration\nareas and fish\nnurseries\nSection\n3.3.3 and\nAnnex\nXII.3.3\nAll once-through\nsystems or cooling\nsystems with\nintakes of surface\nwater\nConstruction \nof\nintake channels\nOptimise water velocities\nin intake channels to limit\nsedimentation; watch for\nseasonal \noccurrence \nof\nmacrofouling\nSection\n3.3.3\n4.6 Reduction of emissions to water\n4.6.1 General BAT approach to reduce heat emissions\nWhether heat emissions into the surface water will have an environmental impact strongly\ndepends on the local conditions. Such site conditions have been described, but do not lead to a\nconclusion on BAT in general terms.\nWhere, in practice, limits to heat discharge were applicable, the solution was to change from\nonce-through technology to open recirculating cooling (open wet cooling tower). From the\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\navailable information, and considering all possible aspects, care must be taken in concluding\nthat this can be qualified as BAT. It would need to balance the penalty increase in overall\nenergy efficiency of applying a wet cooling tower (Chapter 3.2) against the effect of reduced\nenvironmental impact of reduced heat discharge. In a fully integrated assessment at the level of\na river catchment, this could for example include the raised overall efficiency levels of other\nprocesses using the same, but now colder, water source, which becomes available because there\nis no longer a large warm water discharge into it.\nWhere the measures generally aim at reducing the ∆T of the discharged cooling water, a few\nconclusions on BAT can be drawn. Pre-cooling (Annex XII) has been applied for large power\nplants where the specific situation requires this, e.g. to avoid raised temperature of the intake\nwater.\nDischarges will have to be limited with reference to the constraints of the requirements of\nDirective 78/659/EEC for fresh water sources. The criteria are summarised in Table 3.6.\nReference is made to a provision in Article 11 of this directive regarding derogation of the\nrequirements in certain circumstances.\n4.6.2 General BAT approach to reduce chemical emissions to water\nPrevention and control of chemical emissions resulting from cooling systems have received the\nmost attention in Member States’ policies and industry. Next to heat discharge they are still\nconsidered to be the most important issue in cooling.\nReferring to the statement that 80% of the environmental impact is decided on the design table,\nmeasures should be taken in the design phase of wet cooling system using the following order of\napproach:\n• \nidentify process conditions (pressure, T, corrosiveness of substance),\n• \nidentify chemical characteristics of cooling water source,\n• \nselect the appropriate material for heat exchanger combining both process conditions and\ncooling water characteristics,\n• \nselect the appropriate material for other parts of the cooling system,\n• \nidentify operational requirements of the cooling system,\n• \nselect feasible cooling water treatment (chemical composition) using less hazardous\nchemicals or chemicals that have lower potential for impact on the environment (Section\n3.4.5, Annex VI and VIII)\n• \napply the biocide selection scheme (Chapter 3, Figure 3.2) and\n• \noptimise dosage regime by monitoring of cooling water and systems conditions.\nThis approach intends to reduce the need for cooling water treatment in the first place. For\nexisting systems technological changes or changes to the equipment are difficult and generally\ncost-intensive. Focus should be on the operation of the systems using monitoring linked to\noptimized dosage. A few examples of techniques with good performances have been identified.\nThey are generally applicable for certain categories of systems, they are considered cost\neffective and do not need large changes to the cooling installation.\nAfter reducing the sensitivity of the cooling system to fouling and corrosion, treatment may still\nbe needed to maintain an efficient heat exchange. Selecting cooling water additives less harmful\nto the aquatic environment and to applying them in the most efficient way is then the next step.\nWith respect to the selection of chemicals, it has been concluded that a ranking of treatments\nand the chemicals of which they are composed is difficult if not impossible to carry out in a\ngeneral way and would be unlikely to lead to BAT conclusions. Due to the large variation in\nconditions and treatments only a site-by-site assessment will lead to the appropriate solution.\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nSuch an assessment and its constituent parts could represent an approach that can be considered\nBAT.\nThis approach is offered in this BREF and consists of a tool that can assist in a first ranking of\nselected chemicals and of an approach to assess biocides, linking the requirements of the\ncooling system to requirements of the receiving aquatic ecosystem (Annex VIII). The approach\naims at minimising the impact of cooling water additives and, in particular, biocides. The\nBiocidal Products Directive 98/8/EC (BPD) and the Water Framework Directive (WFD) form\nthe key building blocks for this approach. It is essential to use PEC and PNEC values for the\ndifferent substances, where the PEC/PNEC ratio could function as a yardstick for BAT\ndetermination.\nOn the application of specific substances, much experience has been obtained in once-through\nsystems with chlorine-derived components (in particular hypochlorite, chloramine) and\nchlorine/bromine combinations, as well as with the application of reduced concentration levels.\nThe same applies to the use of biocides for conditioning of recirculating systems. Treatments for\nthese systems are often multisubstances. It is clear that some components or substances can be\nidentified as not BAT or should not be applied at all. A general approach to select the\nappropriate biocide will include local aspects, such as the water quality objectives of the\nreceiving surface water.\n\nChapter 4\nIndustrial Cooling

Noise emissions of cooling installations are part of the total\nnoise emissions from the site. A number of primary and secondary measures have been\nidentified that can be applied to reduce noise emissions where necessary. The primary measures\nchange the sound power level of the source, where the secondary measures reduce the emitted\nnoise level. The secondary measures in particular will lead to pressure loss, which has to be\ncompensated by extra energy input, which reduces overall energy efficiency of the cooling\nsystem. The ultimate choice for a noise abatement technique will be an individual matter, as will\nthe resulting associated performance level. The following measures and minimum reduction\nlevels are considered as BAT.\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n4.8.2 Identified reduction techniques within the BAT-approach\nTable 4.9: BAT for the reduction of noise emissions\nCooling system\nCriterion\nPrimary BAT approach\nAssociated\nreduction\nlevels\nRef.\nReduce noise of\ncascading water at\nair inlet\nDifferent techniques\navailable\n≥ 5 dB(A)\nSection 3.6\nNatural draught\ncooling towers\nReduce noise\nemission around\ntower base\nE.g application of earth\nbarrier or noise\nattenuating wall\n< 10 dB(A)\nSection 3.6\nSection 3.6\nReduction of fan\nnoise\nApply low noise fan with\ncharacteristics, e.g.:\n- \nlarger diameter fans;\n- \nReduced tip speed\n(≤ 40 m/s)\n< 5 dB(A)\nSection 3.6\nOptimised diffuser\ndesign\nSufficient height or\ninstallation of sound\nattenuators\nVariable\nSection 3.6\nMechanical draught\ncooling towers\nNoise reduction\nApply attenuation\nmeasures to inlet and\noutlet\n≥ 15 dB(A)\nSection 3.6\n4.9 Reduction of risk of leakage\n4.9.1 General approach\nTo reduce the risk of leakage, attention must be paid to the design of the heat exchanger, the\nhazardousness of the process substances and the cooling configuration.

All measures\nare more or less within the good maintenance practice that would apply to a recirculating wet\ncooling system in general. The more critical moments are start-up periods, where systems’\noperation is not optimal, and standstill for repair or maintenance. For new towers consideration\n\nChapter 4\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nmust be given to design and position with respect to surrounding sensitive objects, such as\nhospitals, schools and accommodation for elderly people.\n4.10.2 Identified reduction techniques within the BAT-approach\nTable 4.11: BAT to reduce biological growth\nCooling system\nCriterion\nPrimary BAT approach\nRemarks\nReference\nReduce algae\nformation\nReduce light energy\nreaching the cooling\nwater\nSection\n3.7.3\nReduce biological\ngrowth\nAvoid stagnant zones\n(design) and apply\noptimized chemical\ntreatment\nCleaning after\noutbreak\nA combination of\nmechanical and chemical\ncleaning\nSection\n3.7.3\nAll wet\nrecirculating\ncooling systems\nControl of pathogens\nPeriodic monitoring of\npathogens in the cooling\nsystems\nSection\n3.7.3\nOpen wet cooling\ntowers\nReduce risk of\ninfection\nOperators should wear\nnose and mouth\nprotection (P3-mask)\nwhen entering a wet\ncooling tower\nIf spraying\nequipment is\non or when\nhigh-pressure\ncleaning\nSection\n3.7.3\n\nChapter 5\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n5 CONCLUDING REMARKS\n5.1 Timing of the work\nThe work on this BAT Reference document started in June 1997 with the kick-off meeting on\n19-20 June 1997 describing the scope and the key environmental issues. Originally the scope\nincluded vacuum systems as well, but due to their highly process-related characteristics it was\nconsidered to be too complex to cover in a general way and was left out of the work.\nTwo drafts were issued to the Technical Working group (TWG) for consultation. The first draft\nwas issued in June 1999 and the second in March 2000. In both consultation periods comments\nand new information were submitted.\nThe final TWG meeting was held on the 29-31 May 2000 and a high level of consensus was\nobtained on content as well as on the BAT conclusions was obtained. There was general support\nfor BAT conclusions on the horizontal subject of industrial cooling systems. The reference to\nlocal aspects and its consequences for the BAT conclusion were strongly debated. The\noptimisation of cooling water conditioning as a major aspect of cooling systems operation was\nalso heavily discussed. Comments and new information submitted during and after the meeting\nhave been incorporated in the final report.\nIn the main part of the document, the general approach to arrive at BAT for industrial cooling\nsystems is explained. The main conclusions on BAT are presented in Chapter 4. A large number\nof annexes illustrates the general concepts with practical examples.\n5.2 Sources of information\nAs sources of information a large number of documents, reports and information from cooling\nsystem operators and authorities as well as from suppliers of equipment and cooling water\nchemicals has been used to draft the document.\nOf these the documents tm001 (NL), tm056 and tm132 (Power Industry) and tm139 (Equipment\nsuppliers) can be considered as general building blocks. Other information submitted was more\nfocused on a particular environmental issue, where the emphasis was largely on cooling water\nconditioning.\nInformation was further obtained during site visits and by personal communication on selection\nof technology and on experiences with the application of reduction techniques.\n5.3 Recommendations for future work\nCooling is an essential element in many industrial processes. The assessment of best available\ntechniques for cooling systems has revealed that internal heat management, selection and\noperation of the cooling system and the resulting emissions to the environment are directly\nrelated. However, the BREF-process has not been able to identify examples that give a\nquantified illustration of this principle and a future BREF would benefit from further\ninvestigation.\nWithin the Technical Working Group there clearly is agreement that BAT for cooling systems is\nan approach within which a number of specific techniques can be identified. It is a complex\nissue involving thermodynamic principles and interaction with the characteristics of the process.\nIt is clear that BAT for cooling systems is a balance of the demands of the industrial process to\nbe cooled, the design and operation of the cooling system and the costs. For this purpose a\n\nChapter 5\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nBAT-approach is developed with the emphasis on prevention by technological changes and\nimproving operating practice. This approach makes a distinction between new and existing\ncooling systems, but in this document it is emphasised that reduction measures in existing\ncooling systems have the same objective. In other words, the same approach applies, but it is\nclear that options for reduction are limited in existing cooling systems.\nThe process of exchange of information has made it possible to identify a number of techniques\nthat can be considered BAT on a general level, as presented in Chapter 4.\nTo determine techniques under the primary BAT approach for cooling systems, however, has\nbeen difficult. There seems to be reluctance to identify specific reduction techniques in the\nframework of a horizontal issue, where general application may not be so obvious.\nOn the change in technology with an associated reduction in emissions no detailed information\non a practical example has been made available to illustrate the potential for improvements,\nacknowledging that identical changes in similar cooling configurations could still have different\nassociated reduction levels. Comparisons of the performance of systems would need comparable\nunits and it is suggested that performance data be expressed per unit of heat dissipated (MWth).\nExamples can be found in the document, where this was feasible.\nConcerning the environmental issues associated with the operation of the industrial cooling\nsystems in the scope of this document, emphasis is largely on reduction of emissions to the\naquatic environment. Few data were reported that are considered as representative and an\ninventory is recommended to be able to get a better picture, which could serve as a benchmark\nfor results of (future) reduction techniques.\nThe TWG considers the selection of cooling water additives to be an important pathway to\nreduce potentially harmful emissions to the aquatic environment. A general assessment\nprocedure which includes local characteristics is necessary to make a selection at a local level.\nTwo concepts are presented in this BREF to aid the local assessment of cooling water additives.\nThe TWG considers both concepts as valuable tools, but the benchmark concept (Annex VIII.1)\nis still a theoretical model and will need further examination.\nEmissions to air from wet cooling towers may contain chemicals or bacteria, but it was a\ncommon view in the TWG that very few data exist. To identify their importance would need\naccurate measurement to quantify emissions, given certain water conditioning regimes and\nefficiency of the drift eliminators. Further investigation on available data will be needed.\nIn some Member States a lot of attention is currently paid to the development of Legionella in\nwet cooling towers as a result of some recent outbreaks of Legionnaires disease. Hence the\nrelatively large section paying attention to this aspect. From the information submitted it is clear\nthat further work is needed to establish representative concentration levels of Legionella and to\nimprove treatments for systems cleaning after outbreaks as well as for daily maintenance.\nA maximum level of acceptable colony forming units (CFU) in a cooling system with an\nassociated low risk has not been determined. At present it is not clear if such a level can be\nidentified and future work may identify progress in this field of work.\nA number of techniques were identified and considered BAT, but some are still in a stage of\ndevelopment and may be considered as emerging. Their application and environmental\nconsequences still have to be assessed. Examples of these techniques are the spray (or\nevaporative) ponds and cold and heat storage.\nIt is recommended that this document be revised in 3 years’ time to assess the above-mentioned\npoints.\n\nReferences\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nREFERENCES\n[Comment-1, ..]\nInformation submitted as comment on the first draft of the BREF-document by TWG-member\n(Member State or institute)\n[Correia, 1995]\nCorreia F.N. et al, Water availability, uses and institutions in Europe, Summary report and\nvertical issues, Congres Center Instituto Superior Técnico (Lissabon (P), 1995).\n[Hadderigh, 1978]\nHadderigh, R.H., 1978.

I\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nANNEX I \nTHERMODYNAMIC PRINCIPLES\nPotentially every change in an industrial cooling system can affect the process of heat exchange.\nWhen applying BAT to industrial cooling systems the consequences for the cooling process\nhave to be assessed also using the thermodynamic principles.\nI.1 \nHeat transfer in a shell and tube heat exchanger\nIn a counter flow design heat exchanger heat is transferred from a warm source to a cold source\nand the heat exchange can be described as follows:\n( )\nA\nU\nT\nQ\nm\n*\n*\nln\n∆\n=\nQ\nheat transferred per unit of time (W)\n∆Tm(ln)\nlogarithmic mean temperature difference LMTD (K)\nU\noverall heat transfer coefficient (W/m²K)\nA\nheat exchanging surface (m²)\nThe LMTD for a tube heat exchanger for counter current flow can be determined with the\nfollowing equation:\n(\n) (\n)\n(\n) (\n)\n{\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nln\nt\nT\nt\nT\nt\nT\nt\nT\nTm\n−\n−\n−\n−\n−\n=\n∆\nT1\n temperature inlet warm process side (K)\nT2\n temperature outlet warm process side (K)\nt1\n temperature inlet cold side (K)\nt2\n temperature outlet cold side (K)\nHeat transfer is promoted by a large surface area (A). For practical reasons there is a limit to the\nsize of the surface area and in that case finned tubes are applied. Different sources of resistance\n(R) form another limitation to heat transfer. Generally, resistance R is expressed as its reciprocal\nvalue of the heat transfer coefficient 1/U and largely consists of the thickness of the wall\nbetween the two media and its conductivity and the state of fouling of the exchanging surface.,\nbut also the conductivity of the liquids is important accounting for the effect of different\nvelocities on heat transfer.\nDepending on the nature of the medium that flows through the heat exchanger, the heat-\nexchanging surface gets fouled. During use of the exchanger the resistance to the transfer of\nheat increases. For design purposes use is made of a pollution coefficient or fouling factor, that\nequals the maximum fouling depending on the nature of the medium or the coolant. In Table I.1\na few examples are given, where a lower fouling factor means a lower state of fouling of the\nheat-exchanging surface.\nTable I.1: Fouling factors for shell and tube heat exchangers, indicative values [Van der Schaaf,\n1995]\nMedium\nFouling factors (W/m2/K)\nRiver water\n3000-12000\nSea water\n1000- 3000\nCooling water (cooling tower)\n3000- 6000\nLight hydrocarbons\n\nHeavy hydrocarbons\n\nAnnex I\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTwo thermodynamic principles are responsible for heat transfer:\ntransfer through conduction (and convection),\ntransfer through evaporation of a medium.\nHeat transfer in a dry cooling system through conduction and convection is called sensible heat\ntransfer. In a wet cooling system water is cooled down by direct contact with air. Sensible heat\ntransfer to air in a dry cooling system can be described as follows:\nT\nm\nC\nQ\na\n∆\n=\n*\n*\nρ\nQ\nheat transferred\nρ\nC\nspecific heat capacity of air\nT\n∆\ntemperature range\na\nm\nmass of air\nIn a wet cooling system there is additionally heat transfer through evaporation, latent heat\ntransfer and can be described with the following formula:\nH\nm\nQ\na\n∆\n=\n*\n'\nQ\nheat transferred\n'\na\nm\nmass of air\nH\n∆\nenthalpy range\nWith these equations the mass of air necessary for dry (ma) and for wet (ma’) cooling can be\ncompared:\nH\nT\nC\nm\nm\na\na\n∆\n∆\n=\n*\n'\nρ\nThe ratio depends on the temperature range ∆T and for example with an increase in air\ntemperature of 10 to 20°C this ratio is about 1:4. In this example it means that dry cooling needs\nfour times more air than wet cooling. In other words, a larger heat exchange surface is required\nfor dry cooling.\nI.2 \nApproach\nIt is always important for a cooling system to provide sufficient driving force in order to achieve\nthe transfer of heat. A minimal temperature difference is necessary between the incoming and\nthe outgoing flow, i.e. the difference between the temperature of the process medium leaving\nthe heat exchanger and the temperature of the coolant (water or air) that enters the heat\nexchanger, based on a counter flow design. This difference in temperature is called the\napproach. For wet cooling towers the approach is defined as the difference between the wet\nbulb temperature of the air and the temperature of the coolant leaving the tower. For dry cooling\ntowers the approach is defined as the difference between the dry bulb temperature of the air and\nthe temperature of the coolant leaving the tower.\nA cooling system is designed to meet specifications throughout the year. Of course, when water\nand air temperatures are low, requirements are easily met. But higher temperatures can cause\nproblems both in operations and for the environment. Through sustained lowering of process\nflow or sustained raising of the amount of cooling medium, the temperature specifications can\neventually be met. There are, however, design limits to this approach. Systems are often\n\nAnnex I\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\ndesigned in such a way that specifications may be exceeded to a maximum of 5% or lower on an\nannual basis.\nFor water-cooling, a minimal approach over the heat exchanger of 3-5K is used. Lower values\ncan be reached, but this requires a larger and therefore more expensive heat-exchanging surface.\nWith more heat exchangers in a cooling system the different individual approaches have to be\nadded up and the more exchangers the higher the approach. For a cooling tower an approach\ntemperature of 7K to 15K is often used.\nFor condensers of power stations the term “thermal difference”, instead of approach, is used\nindicating the difference between the temperature of the condensate (steam) and the temperature\nat which the cooling water leaves the condenser. To calculate the temperature at which\ncondensation can take place the terminal difference and the temperature increase of the cooling\nwater have to be added. In case a cooling tower is used the approach of this tower will have to\nbe added as well. For condensers practical experience shows minimal terminal differences in the\nrange of 3-8K, also depending on the fouling factor [tm056, Caudron, 1991].\nThe minimum end temperature that can be achieved by a cooling system is determined by the\napproach of a cooling system and the design temperature, which depends on the climatic\nconditions of the site.\nI.3 \nCapacity of a heat exchanger\nThe capacity or duty of a heat exchanger is the amount of heat that can be removed. The\nrequired heat transfer area of a cooling system is influenced by the different heat transfer\ncapacities of the cooling media water and air, by sensible and latent heat transfer and by the\ndriving force. The design has to consider material requirements, pollution, drop of pressure,\nflow speed, spatial restrictions and the volume to be cooled (fluid or vapour).\nThe total capacity of a cooling system is determined by adding up the duties (or capacities) of\nall heat exchangers:\n[\n]\norW\ns\nJ\nQ\nQ\ni\ntot\nΣ\n=\n.\n with \n=\ni\nQ\nduty of user i\nDue to its physical properties, water is an ideal heat carrier because of its high thermal capacity.\nIt therefore only requires small heat exchange surfaces. The most effective transfer of heat is by\nevaporation of water. The latent heat (evaporation of water) compared with the specific heat\ncapacity per ∆K at 30ºC is about 630 times higher (Hv/C). The specific heat capacities of air,\nwater, and evaporating water are shown in Table I.2.\nTable I.2: Specific heat capacities of air and water\nAir:\n(sensible heat transfer)\nCp = 1005.6 + (16.03*10-3*t)\nJ/kg/K\nWater:\n(sensible heat transfer)\nC = 4192\nJ/kg at 10ºC\nC = 4182\nJ/kg at 50ºC\nEvaporation of water:\n(latent heat transfer)\nHv = 2502\nkJ/kg at 0ºC\nHv = 2431\nkJ/kg at 30ºC\n\nAnnex I\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nI.4 \nWet and dry bulb temperatures\nThe wet bulb temperature is the lowest temperature, to which air can be cooled down by\nadiabatic evaporation. The wet bulb temperature always lies below dry bulb temperature and\ndepends on the measured temperature of the atmosphere, the humidity and the air pressure. The\ndry bulb temperature is the temperature of dry air and a very important factor in the design of\nair-coolers where sensible heat transfer is the underlying mechanism. Wet and dry bulb\ntemperatures can be the same when ambient air is fully saturated.\nFor latent heat transfer the wet bulb temperature is the relevant temperature and it is\ntheoretically the lowest temperature to which water can be cooled down. In case of wet cooling\ntowers where the heat is transferred from the cooling water to the air mainly by evaporation, the\nwet-bulb temperature (i.e. the degree of saturation) is therefore an important design factor.\nI.5 \nRelation between heat transfer and heat exchanging\nsurface\nA high heat transfer and driving force (approach) will require a relatively small surface,\nresulting in a compact and cost effective heat transfer concept. Because of the lower heat\ntransfer capacity of air, dry cooling systems require much larger heat exchanger surfaces and\ndriving force for the same cooling capacity. This larger heat exchange surface results in a higher\ndemand on space and potentially higher investment costs against the absence of costs for water\nand cooling water treatment and the associated environmental effects.\nThe required heat exchanging area also depends on the medium that is to be cooled. As an\nexample of this Table I.3 shows examples of heat transfer coefficients and the associated\nsurface areas of various combinations of cooling water and process fluids.\nTable I.3: Heat transfer coefficients and estimated surface areas A (m2) per MW and at 20K mean\ntemperature difference for different industrial applications\n[Bloemkolk, 1997].\nHot process side\nHeat transfer coefficient U\n(W/m2 K)\nEstimated surface area(2) A\n(m2 per MW)\nFluids\n-organic solvent\n-light oil\n-heavy oil\n-gases\nCondensing vapours(l)\n-water vapour\n-organic vapour\n-vacuum condensers (water)\n-organics (partly condensing)\n250-750\n350-900\n60-300\n20-300\n1000-1500\n700- 1000\n500-700\n200-500\n200-600\n55-143\n166-830\n166-2500\n33-50\n50-71\n71-100\n100-250\nNotes:\n1. Starting point is ∆T(ln)=20°C. Cooling with water. Calculation is based on overall heat exchange\ncoefficient U and is meant as a comparison\n2. It should be taken into account that condensing vapours per kg drain off much more heat than cooling\nfluids; per MW heat discharged, relatively little vapour is therefore condensed.\n3. Q=U.A.∆T(ln)\nAs an example of what the above could mean two cases of installed cooling systems, one for dry\ncooling and one for evaporative cooling, are compared and the results are shown in Table I.4.\n\nAnnex I\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nThe dry cooling tower with a cooling surface diameter of 20% more, has only 47% of the\ncapacity of the evaporative cooling system with an approach of 20 K compared to 12.6 K.\nTable I.4: Effects of the cooling principle on the capacity, approach and cooling surface of a cooling\nsystem\n[132, Eurovent, 1998]\nCharacteristics\nDry natural draught cooling\ntower\nWet natural draught cooling\ntower\nCapacity\n895 MWth\n1900 MWth\nCooling surface diameter\n145 m\n120 m\nApproach\n20 K\n12.6 K\nTemperature (dry bulb / wet bulb)\n14/ 10 °C\n11/ 9 °C\nMinimum end temperatures\n34 °C\n21.6°C\n\nAnnex II\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nANNEX II \nPRINCIPLE OF ENERGY SAVING THROUGH\nOPTIMISED COOLING\n[tm059, Paping, 1995]\nII.1 \nSubject\nThis Annex reviews a method of calculation of the potential energy conservation in the event\nthat cooling is carried out at lower temperatures. The conservation is expressed in terms of\nprimary energy, with a dimensionless unit of kWth/MWth per K temperature difference in the\ncooling process itself. The reduction in energy consumption is achieved by the use of inhibitors\nthat have been subjected to a standard test method. These inhibitors ensure that the water\ncoolers remain cleaner during the summer months. The direct and indirect energy use because\nof the choice of any of the six main cooling systems in a specific area can also be calculated\nwith this dimensionless number.\nII.2 \nSummary of conclusions\n• \nIn practice the variable temperature gradients across fouling are of the order of magnitude\nof 1 to 4K.\n• \nColder cooling water in the immediate vicinity of the pipe wall results in energy\nconservation of 3½ kWth/MWth/K. This is equivalent with EUR 300 per MWth cooling per\nannum per K temperature difference.1\n• \nThe use of an efficient manner to combat the decrease in the heat transfer coefficient across\nfouling of heat exchangers results in a potential energy conservation for the European\nindustrial sector pro ratio of this energy conservation factor. For every 100 GWth cooling in\nEurope the energy conservation potential is 11 PJth per annum2 per K. This is equivalent\nto a reduction of the emissions of carbon dioxide of 700 thousand tons per annum per K for\nevery 100 GWth cooling in Europe.\n• \nThe involved energy consequences of the choice for each of the six main cooling systems\nare even more significantly. The difference in minimum attainable cooling water\ntemperature for each of the six main cooling water systems can also be expressed in\nnecessary energy expenditure to cool. The same “dimensionless” factor of 3½ kWth/MWth/K\ncan be applied for comparison of the design alternatives.\n• \nThe use of certain inhibitors in cooling water results in significant energy savings. These\nsavings can exceed the primary energy content of the additives by several factors of ten.\nThe environmental impact decreases in proportion to these savings.\n• \nThe energy conservation achieved by the use of inhibitors exceeds the costs of the relevant\nadditives by a very wide margin.\nAn illustration of both effects, as discussed in this Annex, is presented in Figure II.1. A lower\ntemperature of the coolant as well as the use of antifouling treatment will effect the heat transfer\nthrough the exchanger wall and the waterfilm.\n\nBased on $14.7 /barrel; with an energy value of 41.87 GJth/ metric tonne oil equivalent and 7.45 barrels/ metric tonne oil\nequivalent, representing 5.51 barrels per kWth year or 81 EUR /kWth year (Ministry of Economic Affairs, Netherlands, oil/gas\nconversion table NOVEM).\n\nPJth = Petajoule thermal = 1015 Joule.\n\nAnnex II\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n Tproduct\n∆θfouling\n∆θwaterfilm\n}\nEvery 0.12 mm = 1 K\nPotential energy saving\nExtra temperature gradient = Energy loss\npipe\n} Potential energy saving\n∆θdifference cooling system choice\n Tproduct,\nminimum energy\nthrough BAT\n Tcooling water\nFigure II.1: Illustration of areas of potential energy saving by reduction of the temperature\ngradient through a fouling layer as well as by using colder cooling water influent\nII.3 \nIntroduction\nFollowing many informal contacts a number of multinationals with branches in the Europe\nfounded the industrial cooling-water group in 1991. They took the initiative to develop a\nstandard test method for cooling-water inhibitors. The basis of this method was formed by the\nresearch carried out in the nineteen-eighties by DSM and Shell. The “Industrial Cooling-Water\nProject” was set up in the form of a joint project in which both the customers for and suppliers\nof these inhibitors participated.\nThe potential conservation in energy - in combination with the reduction in malfunctions of the\nproduction process achieved by the use of cleaner heat exchangers - was the most important\nmotive for all partners to decide to invest in the project. This Annex discusses the issue in more\ndetail.\nThe generation of shaft-power and/or electricity is always accompanied by cooling; this is\nnecessary since only a maximum amount of useful energy can be extracted from a medium at\nany given ambient temperature. A proportion of this energy will pass through a number of\nprocess steps, and will ultimately reach the factory’s cooling-water system. The yearly\naverages3 for the standard direct energy consumption expended in cooling, expressed in terms of\nthe ratio KWe / MWth, cooling and assuming clean coolers in the summer months, is shown in the\nfollowing table.\n\nASHREA Handbook, 1983 Equipment volume; American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers\nInc., Atlanta, USA, 1983.\n\nAnnex II\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable II.1: Energy consumption in kWe, electricity consumption / MWth, cooling with clean heat exchangers\nCooling water-system\nEnergy consumption in kWe, electricity consumption / MWth, cooling\nwith clean heat exchangers.\nΣ\nCooling-water\npump\nFan\nOnce-through cooling water\n≈ 10; range 5 to 25\n5 to 25\nn/a\nCirculation-cooling water with open\nwet cooling tower\n≈ 15; range 10 to 25\n5 to 20\n5 to 10\nClosed recirculating system\n≈ 30; range 20 to 60\n5 to 15\n10 to 50\nWith an efficiency of the generation of electricity of 40%4 the above figures will need to be\nmultiplied by 2.5 to express the energy consumption in terms of the primary energy carrier. The\nrelative energy consumption required to cool by means of a water system then becomes\ndimensionless.\nMoreover this energy consumption will increase in direct proportion to the (higher)\ntemperatures of the cooling water and/or (increased) fouling of the coolers during the summer\nmonths. To calculate the indirect energy consumption in a more reliable way the previous tables\nin this document have to be linked. (The climatic conditions of the European countries\nmentioned in Table 1.6, and the technical and thermodynamic characteristics of the different\ncooling systems for industrial applications for a specific general site’s climate mentioned in\nTable 2.1). The following table shows the lowest attainable water temperatures at inlet for the\nvarious cooling systems during the months of July and August in the Netherlands.\nIn practice virtually no tap water or groundwater is used for cooling. Moreover it is less\ndesirable to make use of these kinds of water for this purpose, and the practice is gradually\nbeing discontinued. Consequently it is possible to state that once-through cooling-water systems\nlocated on the coast consume the least amount of primary energy.\nTable II.2: Mean attainable lowest cooling water inlet temperatures for the various cooling systems\nduring the months of July and August in the Netherlands.\nCooling system\nMean attainable min.\ntemp.[°C]\nRemarks; Netherlands as\nexample\nOnce-through cooling: \nriver\n\nLocal limitations of heat\ndischarge by thermal limit\nvalues\nSeawater along the coast\n\nNorth sea 12 °C below\nmixing zone\ntap-water\n\nCost price\ngroundwater\n\nLimited stock\nOpen wet cooling tower\n\nWet bulb 19°C\nAir cooling; (for comparison)\n40 (product temp.)\nDry bulb 28°C\n\nCentral Bureau for Statistics, CBS, The Hague.\n\nAnnex II\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nMoreover the energy consumption will increase when the heat exchangers are fouled. This\nsediment can be classified into microfouling and macrofouling. Blockages caused by shellfish\nand other solid sediment preventing the flow of water through the pipes may be regarded as\nmacrofouling5. Microbial slime, scaling, deposits, that each in turn result in the formation of\ncorrosion products on or in the warm cooling pipe, are all classified as microfouling6. A\ncharacteristic common to all the various forms of fouling mechanisms is the concomitant\nincrease in the internal energy consumption.\nThis annex discusses the additional energy consumption per K extra temperature gradient in\nmore detail as well as it presents the calculation basics for the direct and indirect energy\nconsequences of .the choice of each of the six cooling systems.\nII.4 \nCalculations\nII.4.1 Principles\nIndustrial cooling installation\n∆ θ log\n= 10\nK\n(= driving force)\nΦ t\n= 5\nkWth m-2\n(= heat flux)\nconsequently a\nU total\n= 0.5\nkWth m-2 K-1 (= overall heat\ntransfer coefficient)\nAssume a deposit\nδ fouling\n= 0.12\nmm\n(= variable resistance)\nwith a\nλ fouling\n= 0.6\nW m-1 K-1(= thermal\nconductivity)7\nHeat transfer is conceived to be analogous to a series of resistances between the product to be\ncooled, the pipe wall, the laminar layer of water, and the variable degree of fouling:\nα\nα\nα\nα\nfouling\nlayer\nwater\nwall\npipe\nproduct\ntotal\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n=\nU\n\n T product\n∆θpollutio n\n∆θwaterfilm\nTcoo ling water\n}\nEvery 0.12 m m = 1 K\nPotential energy saving\nP ollution = E xtra tem perature gradient\npipe\nFigure II.2: Graphic representation of pollution factors responsible for extra temperature gradient\nover the pipe wall\n\nDutch experience with condenser maintenance, E.J.

This is based on the necessity of\npreventing certain process flows from being cooled to too low a temperature. Factories shall\nalways keep at least one cooling-water pump in operation; a fan that has been stopped is\nincapable of a further reduction in its capacity. Savings can be achieved during a longer period\nof time in power stations. However, industrial cooling installations are usually deployed to cool\na variety of products, and consequently exhibit a great variety in types of heat-exchange\nmaterial. As a result of this diversity, industrial cooling installations have a need for an\nappropriate design of the use of inhibitors to accommodate their complex systems, in turn\nresulting in the utilization of the maximum benefits of the calculated energy conservation during\nonly four months in a year. Consequently the calculations in this annex are restricted to this\nshort period, and are applicable only to the cooling capacity of water systems used in industrial\ninstallations. The reason for these restrictions is that the interpretation of cooling-water\nadditives would have been undermined if power stations had also been included in these\ncalculations of the energy conservation.\nIn practice one or more “solutions” are used to remedy situations in which the design of the\ncooling system in combination with the inhibitor is incapable of supplying the required cooling\ncapacity during the summer months. (These solutions are comprised of increasing the amount of\ncooling water and/or cooling air and/or the product temperature and/or the process pressure). All\nsuch solutions share the common characteristic of a concomitant increase in the internal energy\nconsumption.\n\nAnnex II\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTin\ntout\nTout, product\ntin, cooling water\nLength heat exchanger\nPollution compensation through:\n* more cooling water\n* more cooling air\n* higher product temperature\n* higher process pressure\nDriving force\nFigure II.3: Schematic representation of driving force over the length of a heat exchanger\nIn the following calculations the additional energy consumption resulting from microfouling is\nexpressed in terms of a 1°C extra temperature gradient across the fouling. The formulae shown\non the previous page indicate that an extra 1 °C temperature gradient already becomes apparent\nonce a microbial slime layer has attained a thickness of no more than an order of magnitude of\n0.12mm. This is also applicable to a layer of boiler-scale with a thickness of the same order of\nmagnitude. The calculations assume that the heat transfer decreases linearly with the thickness\nof the fouling. The reduction in heat-exchanger capacity caused by the first 20% of blocked\ncooling pipes due to macrofouling can be compensated by increasing the required temperature\ngradient by 1°C. However every additional blocked cooling pipe will result in an exponential\nincrease in the additional temperature gradient required.\nCooling tower discharging 10 MWth \nΦ\n=\n1000 m3 h-1\ncirculation flow rate\n∆ θ \n=\n8.6 K\ncooling water\ninlet/outlet\n∆ θ log =\n5.0 K\ncooling tower cooling\nlimit\nII.4.2 Quantity of cooling water ↑\nThe following is an example of a calculation in which a 1K extra temperature gradient across\nmicrofouling is, in practice, compensated by an increase in the number of cooling-water pumps.\nThe temperature and flow-rate of the product and the quantity of heat removed from the product\nremain constant. The average pressure drop is adjusted to 3.7 bar.\nThe capacity will be doubled by the parallel operation of two identical centrifugal pumps only\nin the event of a purely static pressure. However every successive cooling-water pump brought\ninto operation in a cooling-water system will result in a change of the dynamic head\ncharacteristics. As a consequence of these changes the nominal capacities of the pumps may not\nbe totaled. The resultant reduction in the capacity requires increased power consumption8.\nThe removal of an equal quantity of heat requires the circulation of an extra 10% of cooling\nwater (= 20% extra pump energy) to compensate for the extra 1 K temperature gradient:\n\nPompen (Pumps), L.W.P.

This means that the decrease in\nthe outlet temperature of the product discharged from a fouled heat exchanger will be less than\nthat from a clean heat exchanger. The temperature gradient across the fouling will be virtually\nuniformly distributed along the entire length of the heat exchanger. As a result of these two\neffects the reduced temperature drop of the product at the outlet of the fouled heat exchanger\nwill be twice the magnitude of the temperature gradient across microfouling on the waterside of\nthe heat exchanger. A pure countercurrent heat exchanger in which the energy content per K\ntemperature change of the cooling-water flow rate (= in fact the specific heat of a quantity) is\ngreater than that of the product to be cooled will exhibit convergent temperature profiles at the\noutlet side of the heat exchanger. The reduced temperature decrease on the product-outlet side\ncaused by microfouling on the waterside will consequently be less than 2 °C per K temperature\ngradient across the fouling. Conversely, energy content per K temperature change of the\ncooling-water flow rate smaller than that of the product to be cooled will result in divergent\ntemperature profiles at the outlet side of the heat exchanger. The reduced temperature decrease\non the product-outlet side caused by the same microfouling on the waterside will then be in\nexcess of 2 °C per K temperature gradient across the fouling on the water-side.\nUnder conditions of adiabatic compression, at a constant product mass and compression ratio,\nthe removal of the same quantity of heat is now achieved by compensating for the extra 1K\ntemperature gradient across the microfouling by increasing the final temperature of the product\nto be cooled by 2 °C.\nThe formula for the same cooling tower of 10 MWth will than be:\n\nAnnex II\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nC\nper \nwork\nssor\nore compre\n percent m\n = \n - \n + \n + \n = \nconsumtion\npower\npressor\n extra com\nT\nT\n \nincrease \ne\ntemperatur\nC product\n \nper \n\n - \nP\nP\n \n * \nκ-\nκ\n * \nT\n * R * \nφ\nV * dP = \nW =\nin\nC\nin + \nout\nin\nη\n * \n κ\n \nκ - \nin\nv\nP\n \nP\npol\nout\nin\n°\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n→\n°\n=\n=\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\b\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n°\n\u0001\n\n\n.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.\nture\ngastempera\ninlet-\n \n the\nof\nfunction \nlinear \n a\nis\nwork\ncompressor\n\n\n\n\nCorrected for 4 summer months per year:\non an annual basis 2 kWe / MWth per K\nConclusion:\nthe displacement of volume is more expensive than mass transport.\nII.4.5 Product pressure ↑; cooling compressor ↑\nFor the same cooling tower of 10 MWth, where, for the same mass flow rate, the removal of the\nsame quantity of heat is now achieved by means of product condensation (for example, for the\nbenefit of a refrigerating machine based on adiabatic compression and expansion).

Conversely, in the summer some of the low-\npressure steam will be disposed of by blowing it off to the atmosphere and/or condensing it in\n\nCentral Bureau for Statistics, CBS, The Hague.\n\nAnnex II\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\ncoolers. Moreover a number of steam pumps will be shut down, and some electric motors will\nbe started up, so as to compensate for the shift in the energy balance.\nSteam turbines are also used as auxiliary turbines to power refrigerating machines. In such\nsituations the extra low-pressure steam produced and exhausted during the summer (the\nadditional amount generated as a result of fouled product condensers) will be disposed of. The\nextra energy consumed by the refrigerating machine will then be accompanied by extra energy\nlosses, which will be a magnitude of 5 larger. The enthalpy of superheated high, medium and\nlow-pressure steam is only one-fifth higher than the latent heat of water.\nThe Dutch Industry uses 20% of the total cooling capacity for compressor gas and refrigerated\ncooling 11. Half of this refrigerated cooling is carried out by means of (auxiliary) steam turbines.\n“Frigories” (or “negative” calories) are more expensive than calories, and volume displacements\nare more expensive than mass transport. In practice this means that during the summer months\npreference will be given to starting up cooling-water pumps and fans earlier, and shutting them\ndown later, rather than increasing the process pressures. Furthermore, in the first instance 80%\nof the capacity lost by inefficient cooling due to fouling will be compensated by means of\nstart/stop commands to motors.\nConsequently the average increase in primary energy per K temperature gradient is:\nK\nper \n \nMW\n / \nkW\n \n.\n.\n.\nth\nth\n3.5\n \n=\n\n\n\n* \n \n%\n\n+\n\n\n\n* \n \n%\n\n+\n\n\n\n* \n \n%\n\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\n\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0004\n\u0005\n\u0006\nNote: The above expressed energy factor can be calculated for other European countries as well, if\nthe relative cooling capacity for compressor gas and refrigerated cooling is known. It is\nexpected that the outcome will range between 3 and 4 kWth / MWth per K, since the power\ngeneration efficiency in Europe is also around 40%.\nII.5.2 Total water used for cooling in the Dutch industry (excl. power\nplants)\nNumbers regarding cooling water consumption, have to be available to calculate the absolute\ndirect and indirect energy usage as well as the absolute environmental impact of each of the six\nmain cooling systems on a European scale. In the Netherlands, these statistical data were\navailable with a spread over the last decades. The majority of the water consumed by the\nnational industry (= 3.1 * 109 m3 per annum) is destined for use in cooling. The total amount of\nwater used for cooling purposes amounts to 2.7 * 109 m3 per annum (for power plants 8.3*109\nm3 p.a.). Of this water the majority is fresh, salt or brackish surface water. The original\nstatistical sources differentiate between water used for general purposes and for cooling.\nHowever this data makes no differentiation between the proportions of water used to feed\nrecirculating and once-through cooling-water systems. Calculations indicate that the amount of\nheat removed by water systems in the Dutch industrial sector is of the order of magnitude of 180\nPJth per annum 12 (= 5.7 GWth 13) and equally partitioned between cooling towers and once\nthrough systems.\n\nEST Consult B.V., Woubrugge, December ’90, NESR003.

However, the\nlinited availability of groundwater restricts the use of this way of energy conservation.\nII.8 \nAppendix environmental impacts\nTable II.3: Conservation ratios for once-through and recirculating cooling system\nType of cooling system\nEnergy-\nConservation ratio\nJ output / J input\nFinancial-\nConservation ratio\nEUR output / EUR input\nMass-\nRatio environment\nCO2 / C-X\nOnce-through cooling system\n\n\n\nOpen recirculating cooling\nsystem\n\n\n\nTable II.4: Energy conservation with potential colder cooling water source\nSystem comparison\nkW th per MW th\nRemarks\nCoastal waters versus cooling towers\n\ngeographically specified\nRiverwater versus cooling towers\n\nlocal thermal burden\nGroundwater versus cooling towers\n\nlimited stock\nThe above-presented numbers can be used to show the outcome for specific areas in Europe,\nlike for instance a high-industrialised area like the Netherlands. The replacement of all industrial\ncooling towers by once-through cooling systems supplied with river water would result in a\nnational energy conservation of 91 PJth 18 * 16 kWth/MWth = 15 PJth per annum (equivalent to a\nreduction of the emission of carbon dioxide of 93000 metric tonnes per annum). This would\nrequire the availability of 85 m3/sec river water throughout the entire year. Conversely, only\nthose cooling systems located at a relatively small distance from a river would come into\nconsideration for such a replacement; the distances otherwise involved would negate the energy\nadvantages offered by the use of this source of water. So it isn’t surprising that most industries\nand power stations are located nearby rivers and coastal areas, emphasising the importance of a\nproper cooling design and location choice.\n\nWater symposium 1995; syllabus 43, Nederlands Corrosie Centrum Bilthoven.\n\nAnnex III\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nANNEX III \nSHELL AND TUBE HEAT EXCHANGERS FOR\nINDUSTRIAL \nONCE-THROUGH \nCOOLING\nSYSTEMS AND THE OCCURRENCE OF LEAKAGE\nThe design of the heat exchanger is extremely important, as it is the key element of a cooling\nsystem, where the exchange of heat takes place. From an environmental point of view it is there,\nwhere leakage from process substances to the coolant can occur. In once-through cooling\nsystems the relevance of a well designed, operated and maintained heat exchanger is obvious.\nFrom a preventive approach attention should be paid to the issues presented in this Annex\nbefore considering a move towards an indirect (secondary) system. This Annex gives a\nsummary of a number of important issues to take into account in the design of the commonly\nused shell and tube heat exchanger to avoid environmental problems [tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nThe shell and tube heat exchanger consists of a shell, a great number of parallel tubes, tube\nplates (tube sheets) baffles and one or two heads. Heat exchange between the media takes place\nby pumping the one medium through the tubes and the other medium around the tubes. As this\nhappens the heat is transported through the tube wall. Diagonally on the tubes are baffles. The\nbaffles ensure a better transfer of heat (through increased turbulence of the flow around the\ntubes) and support the tubes. The shell & tube heat exchanger is reproduced in a picture below.\nFigure III.1: Major components of shell & tube heat exchanger\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nThere are a great many different types of shell & tube heat exchangers. By making the right\nchoice from the design parameters below, the design can be adapted to the specific process and\nmaintenance requirements:\n• \nthe type of shell and head\n• \nthe type of tube (straight or U-shaped, with or without fin)\n• \nthe size of the tube (diameter and length)\n• \nthe distance between the tubes (pitch) the configuration (lay-out)\n• \nthe number of baffles the type of baffle\n• \nthe distance of the baffle (baffle pitch)\n• \nthe number of passes through the tubes (tube passes)\n• \nthe flow pattern (counter flow, concurrent flow)\n• \neither mechanical or not, cleaning either with (high pressure) water or not\n\nAnnex III\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe Tubular Exchanger Manufacturers Association (TEMA) has drafted a nomenclature for the\nvarious types of shell & tube heat exchangers. TEMA has also drafted mechanical design\nguidelines.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of the shell & tube heat exchanger are listed below.\nAdvantages:\n• \navailable for all applications\n• \navailable in almost all materials\n• \nwide range of flows and capacities (duties)\n• \nsturdy, safe construction\n• \ngood thermal and mechanical design methods available\nDisadvantages\n• \nrelatively expensive per m2 heat exchanging surface area\n• \nnot optimal for heat transfer\n• \ncleaning (drawing the tube bank) of the shell side is laborious\nBecause of the sturdy and safe construction of the shell & tube heat exchanger, refineries prefer\nthis type of heat exchanger. The choice of this type of shell & tube heat exchanger for once-\nthrough systems is explained further below.\nIII.1 \nDesign of the shell & tube heat exchanger for one\nthrough systems\nAs a rule, the shell & tubes of the TEMA-type AES are used for once-through systems. The\ncooling water flows through the tubes and the process medium through the shell. AES refers to\nthe codes used to describe the different options for shell and tube heat exchangers (Figure III.2)\nAllocation media\nBecause the tube side of the shell & tube heat exchanger can be cleaned easier and better than\nthe shell side, heavy fouling media are allocated to the tube side. Because of the use of\ncorrosion-resistant materials for corrosive cooling water, it is also more economic to have the\ncooling water flow on the tube side.\nA-Type of front end head\nOpening the shell & tube heat exchanger for inspection and maintenance is easiest with an A-\ntype 'front end head', because the connecting tubes do not need to be dislodged when opening\nthis type of head. For this reason, this type of head is almost always used for heat exchangers\nwith a \"polluting\" medium on the tube side.\nE-Type of shell\nThe choice for the type of shell depends on the process requirements for the medium on the\nshell side. Usually, the E-type is chosen (\"one-pass-shell\").\nS-Type of rear end head\nThe choice of the type \"rear end head\" is determined by factors relating to:\n• \nthe need to clean (mechanically or with water) the shell side\n• \nthe need to clean (mechanically or with water) the tube side\n• \nquality of the cooling water (corrosive, scaling, etc.)\n• \noccurrence of thermal expansion between shell and tube material\n• \nneed for counterflow\n\nAnnex III\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFigure III.2: Heat exchanger nomenclature (Standards of the tubular Exchanger Manufacturers\nAssociation)\n[tm003, Van der Schaaf, 1995]\nUsually the S-type ('floating head' type) is chosen because this type can be cleaned\nmechanically (or with water) on both the shell and the tube side. There are also no problems\nwith this type in the event of thermal expansion differences between the shell and tube material.\nHowever, the S-type is the most expensive type of 'rear end head'.\n\nAnnex III\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nIII.2 \nLeakage in shell & tube heat exchangers\nLeakage, and with it contamination of cooling water by the process medium, occurs in shell &\ntube heat exchangers in most cases as a result of flaws in the tube-tube plate connection, flaws\nin the tube itself and flaws in the flanged connection that separates both flows ('floating head').\nLeakage can occur primarily as a result of:\n1. poor design (about 30% of the cases)\n2. poor manufacturing\n3. operation that is not within the limits of the design (50-60%)\n4. poor inspection and maintenance\n1. Poor design\nBecause a wrong or poor design irrevocably leads to leakage, during the design phase careful\nthought must be given to the design parameters below:\n• \nchoice of material\n• \nchoice of tube-tube plate connection (rolled or welded)\n• \nchoice of packing type\n• \ntype of detail on packing faces\n• \ndesign of the flanges (thickness, no rotation)\n• \ndesign of the tube plate (thickness, no bending)\n• \ndesign of tube support\nIn this consideration, attention should be given to the 'operating' conditions. They are:\n• \noccurrence of vibration\n• \nthermal expansion differences\n• \nflow division\n• \nflow speeds\nPoor design also includes wrong design of flow speeds and design based on incorrect data.\n2. Poor manufacturing\nA good design, however, is not sufficient to prevent leakage. Poor manufacturing can also lead\nto leakage during operation of the heat exchangers. During manufacturing, the following aspects\nplay a role when it comes to prevention of leakage:\n• \ntightening procedure of the flange bolts\n• \nsmoothness of the treatment of the packing surfaces\n• \ntube hole diameter and tolerance in tube plates and baffles\n• \nrolling or welding procedure for tube-tube plate connection\n3. Operation that is not in keeping with the design\nOperations that differ from the operating conditions for which the heat exchanger has been\ndesigned can lead to damage and ultimately to leakage in the heat exchanger.\nDifferent operation could be:\n• \nthermal shocks\n• \n'upset' condition such as over-pressure and/or too high temperature\n• \nincreased or reduced through-flow of flows\n• \nvibrations\n• \nmussels in tubes (which have become detached from the cooling water tube) combined with\nvibrations\nIn addition, incorrect treatment can occur during maintenance, for instance during cleaning of\nthe tubes with steam or warm water (damage as a result of thermal expansion).\n\nAnnex III\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\n4. Poor inspection and maintenance\nDuring periodic maintenance, the heat exchanger is opened up and the tube bank is pulled,\ncleaned and inspected. Inspection aimed at detecting and/or preventing leaks includes control\nof:\n• \ncorrosion and/or erosion on the inside and outside of tubes and tube-tube plate connection\n• \ncorrosion of packing faces of the flanges\n• \nsize of tube holes in baffles (has the diameter of the openings increased in size?)\n• \nreduced wall thickness of the tubes (special attention must be given to tube ends, tubes\nlocated at baffles and tube corners)\n• \nbent, twisted or torn off tubes\n• \ntubes pressing against each other, loose tubes\n• \nbent tube plates\n• \nsmall cracks (or perforations) in tubes and welded tube-tube plate connection\n• \nsmoothness and condition of packing faces\nPeriodic maintenance always ends with a water pressure test, whereby parts of the heat\nexchanger are pressurised to verify that the heat exchanger is still suitable to operate under the\ndesired pressure levels. In this way, too, the tubes, tube-tube plate connections and flange\nconnections are tested for leaks. To detect leaks, more accurate testing methods are also\navailable. Air ('air and soapy water' test) or helium is used. If flaws or suspicious areas are\nfound, their cause will need to be investigated. Once the cause has been found, corrective\nmeasures will need to be taken. If this is not done, and this applies to dealing with the cause as\nwell as the repair of the parts, there is a large probability of (new) leaks in the future.\nCorrective measures include the plugging of tubes and replacing gaskets. If a company has its\nown workshop, the repair work on a shell & tube heat exchanger will take one to two days. By\nemphasising preventive rather than corrective maintenance, leaks can be prevented. For\ninstance, tube banks can be replaced sooner. Proper logging of maintenance works done and of\nthe occurrence of problems enables better planning of maintenance work. It is recommended\nthat the closing of the heat exchanger and tightening of the bolts is done under supervision to\nprevent future leaks. For this, a tool with a regulated momentum can be used.\nIII.3 \nAlternatives\nThe probability of leakage can be reduced by alternative choices of material, TEMA-type, tube\nplate connection, type of packing and the level of the process pressure of the cooling system.\nChoice of material\nInstead of carbon steel, more high-grade materials such as aluminium-brass copper nickel and\ntitanium can be used for the water side of the heat exchanger. This will make the heat exchanger\nconsiderably more expensive than a heat exchanger whose tubes and tube plates are made of\ncarbon steel (See also Annex IV).\nDifferent heat exchanger\nBy choosing another type of heat exchanger, the probability of leakage can be reduced by a\nconsiderable margin.\nAlternatives are:\n• \na U-tube heat exchanger\n• \na heat exchanger with a double tube plate construction\n• \nboth U-tube and double tube plate construction\nThere is no floating head on the U-tube type heat exchanger and therefore no flange seal on the\nrear end head. The U-tube type is 10 to 15% cheaper than the floating head type. If leakage\noccurs at the tube-tube plate connection in heat exchangers with a double tube plate\n\nAnnex III\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nconstruction, there will be emission into the atmosphere instead of to the other medium. The\ndouble tube plate connection is fairly expensive.\nTube-tube plate connection\nWith a welded tube-tube plate connection there is a much smaller chance of leakage than with a\nrolled construction. Making a rolled connection into a welded connection can make existing\nheat exchangers better leak-proof. In this, there are two welds: a sealing weld (one layer of\nweld) or strength weld (usually two layers of weld). A cost indication shows that the price for a\nwelded construction is about 9 to 11 Euro per tube higher than for a rolled construction.\nType of packing\nWith the flange seal of a floating head, the packing type can be changed. The usual types of\npacking, for instance an 'asbestos-free metal-wound' packing or a cam-profile packing, can be\nreplaced by a seal with a weld ('Schweissdichtung').\n\nAnnex IV\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nANNEX IV \nEXAMPLE OF SELECTION OF MATERIAL FOR\nCOOLING WATER SYSTEMS IN INDUSTRIAL\n(NON-POWER PLANT) APPLICATIONS\n[tm001, Bloemkolk, 1997]\nIV.1 \nIntroduction\nThe selection of construction materials in cooling systems, and especially the selection of\nmaterials for the coolers (heat exchangers), in many cases is a complex matter. It is the result\nbeing a balance between the requirements due to the chemistry of the water and the operational\nrequirements (restricted additive use, number of cycles of concentration). To meet these\nrequirements a large range of materials is offered. This Annex shows a few options for materials\nto be used in case of brackish water for open once-through systems.. It gives a qualitative\nselection of applications. In the individual case, the final selection will need to involve cost\nvalues to make a fair comparison taking into account also the consequences of a selection for\nthe operational costs.\nChoice of materials for heat exchangers\nThere are many factors that come together to determine the ultimate choice of materials for heat\nexchangers, such as:\n• \nComposition and corrosiveness of the cooling water\n• \nManner of operation, e.g. through-flow or re-circulating cooling\n• \nCorrosiveness and nature of the medium to be cooled\n• \nType of cooler\n• \nLife-span\n• \nCosts\nThese are some of the most important criteria that are taken into consideration in the design of a\nnew cooler, on the basis of which ultimately a certain choice of materials is made. In many\ncases, this ultimate choice is the best possible compromise adhering to the principle that the\ncooler must have an economically acceptable 'life-span'. Within this life-span, however, many\ncoolers will start leaking. An important cause of this is that, in practice, the cooler is not used in\naccordance with its design principles, whereas a change of process conditions for a variety of\ndifferent reasons is quite common.\nImportant causes that can lead to leakage are:\n• \ntoo high or too low speeds in the tube bank and poor circulation in the shell (Table IV.1);\n• \npoor water treatment, i.e. applied method and control;\n• \ntoo high metal temperatures on the cooling water side.\nWith regard to temperatures a metal temperature of 60ºC is taken as an upper borderline as\nabove this temperature the majority of corrosion inhibitors is less or not effective. Also in once-\nthrough systems formation of calcium salts occur.\nTable IV.1: Cooling water velocity and type of material\nMaterial\nVelocity (m/s)\nAluminium brass\n1.0 - 2.1\nCopper nickel (90-10)\n1.0 - 2.5\nCopper nickel (70-30)\n1.0 - 3.0\nCarbon steel\n1.0 - 1.8\nAustenitic stainless steel (316)\n2.0 - 4.5\nTitanium\n2.0 – 5.0\n\nAnnex IV\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nChoice of material for pumps\nThe choice of material for a pump is less critical because in many cases this equipment is\ndoubled (has a back up). This means that if a pump breaks clown, the process is often not\ndisturbed. Another factor is that the available walls are often much thicker than is strictly\nnecessary (corrosion allowance).\nChoice of materials for cooling water tubes\nIn most cases carbon steel with a sufficiently high corrosion allowance is chosen for the cooling\nwater tubes. If a corrosion allowance of more than 3 mm is insufficient for an acceptable life\nspan, alternative materials are chosen, such as plastics, carbon steel with an organic\ncoating/concrete or, in exceptional cases, alloys of higher quality, such as stainless steel, monel\nand other nickel alloys, etc. Tubes have an advantage over machines in that they are much easier\nand cheaper to replace, which is why in the choice of materials is less critical.\nIV.2 \nDirect once-through systems (with brackish water)\nThe composition and corrosiveness of \"brackish water\" is not fixed and can vary between\n\"fresh\" surface water and seawater. Brackish water is usually found in the transition area\nbetween rivers and/or other \"freshwater\" outflows and the sea (deltas). The composition and\ncharacteristics can vary widely by location and by season. Local water depth, the level of flow\nthrough (replacement) and the tides can play a role in the corrosiveness of this type of water.\nSome kinds of brackish water have a higher level of corrosiveness than seawater. For instance,\nin shallow water with an abundance of plant growth sulphur compounds can occur as a result of\ndecomposition, which can cause serious pit corrosion in copper alloys. In a lot of cases the\namount of suspended silt is considerable, which can heavily pollute the heat exchangers in the\ninstallation. In these cases, the use of stainless steel is dubious because the formation of pits\n(pitting) will almost certainly occur quickly. Because all of these factors are not well known in\nmost cases, it is recommended that the corrosiveness of brackish water be considered equal to\nthat of seawater with a relatively high level of suspended silt. Another advantage is that there is\nconsiderable knowledge and experience regarding the occurrence of corrosion by seawater.\nPumps\nDepending on the situation, the materials in the table below are often used for pumps in\nbrackish water (other materials are possible, but are usually much more expensive):\nTable IV.2: Materials used for pumps in brackish water\nHousing\nImpeller\nDrive-shaft\nComments\nNodular cast iron)*\nAluminium bronze\nAluminium bronze\nTin bronze\nTin bronze\nTin bronze\nStainless steel 316)*\nAluminium bronze\nAluminium bronze\nStainless steel 316\n\nMonel\nMonel\nMonel\nMonel\n)* Grey cast iron is also possible.\nChance of gratification is\nsignificantly greater. Cast steel is\nalso sometimes used.\n)* Austenitic stainless steel\n(Cr-Ni-Mo 18-8-2)\nThe tendency is to choose a combination for the housing and the fan, whereby the housing is, in\nprinciple, the anodic part of the construction.\n\nAnnex IV\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTubes\nIn most cases, carbon steel with a corrosion allowance is used. Another possibility is to provide\nthe carbon steel with an organic coating, or to concrete it. In both cases the welds are the weak\npoint of the construction.\nNowadays, glass-reinforced epoxy tubes are used increasingly, especially in underground\nsystems. The great advantage of this material is that it is almost completely resistant to\ngroundwater. The installation costs are about the same as those for a carbon steel tubing system\nthat is coated, internally or externally, with an organic coating. Over time, this solution is often\nthe cheaper of the two.\nHeat exchangers/coolers\nAs earlier mentioned, the choice of material in a heat exchanger is somewhat more complex\nbecause, where the tube bank is concerned, the corrosiveness of the medium to be cooled must\nbe taken into account. Assuming that the process medium is not corrosive for the material of the\ntube bank and that possible contamination (for instance, by copper ions) of the process is not\nsignificant, the choice of material is mainly determined by the quality of the water.\nThe possible choice of materials for 'shell & tube' heat exchangers in brackish water is given in\nthe table below (water through the tubes).\nTable IV.3: Materials used for shell&tube heat exchangers in brackish water\nShell/body\nWater casing\nTubes\nTube-plate\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel)*1\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel)*2\nAluminium brass\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel)*2\nAluminium brass\nAluminium bronze\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel)*2\nAluminium brass or and\nCupro-nickel)*4\nCarbon steel with a lining\nof aluminium brass\nCarbon steel\nTin bronze\nstainless steel 316)*3\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel\nCarbon steel)*2\nTitanium)*5\nCarbon steel\nComments Table IV.3:\nThere are various possibilities in the list above. The ultimate choice is largely determined by the\nlevel of corrosiveness of the brackish water and by the process conditions.\n)*1\nTubes of carbon steel are only possible when one is certain that the water is not\ncorrosive (e.g. through practical experience). This is almost never an option.\n)*2\nThe water casings are usually given an organic coating plus a few sacrificial anodes. If\nthe tube plate is made of a more precious metal, an organic coating must be applied to this metal\nto prevent galvanic effects in the water casing.\n)*3\nThe use of austenitic material such as 316 is not without risks. In the event of pollution\nthere is a good probability of pitting. This process can be extremely fast. Another risk is the\npossible occurrence of stress corrosion in this type of material. However, practical experience\nshows that this does not happen often, which is possibly due to the relatively low temperatures\nin this type of system. This risk can be significantly reduced or even prevented if one uses a\nhigher version of alloy, such as 904L, 254SMO or Incoloy 825. These types of material are also\nused when the process side requires this.\n)*4\nCupro-nickel alloys and others are chosen if the design metal temperature is too high for\naluminium brass.\n\nAnnex IV\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n)*5\nIn many cases, titanium is the best choice. It is often assumed that a heat exchanger of\ntitanium is too expensive. The price of this material has fallen dramatically in recent decades\nand it has been economically applied. Expectations are that decreasing cost differences and\nincreasing problems with water treatment will lead to an increased use of Ti compared to that of\nCu-Ni alloys now still applied.\nIn addition to its high resistance to corrosion, even in extremely polluted water, this material has\nvarious advantages:\n• \nExtremely thin walled tubes can be used, so less material per m2 heating surface area.\n• \nThe conductivity of heat is very good.\n• \nThe scrap value is high and the material well suited for reuse.\n• \nIt has a long life expectancy.\nA disadvantage is that biological growth is stronger than is the case, for instance, with copper-\ncontaining alloys. It therefore requires extra use of biocides. Another thing is that titanium\ncannot be used in a reducing environment, because no protective oxide layer is formed.\nIV.3 \nIndirect once-through system (brackish water/demin-\nwater)\nIn the indirect (secondary) once-through system, the heat is absorbed in a closed secondary\ncooling circuit, after which the absorbed heat is transferred to an open once-through system via\na heat exchanger. Characteristically, in these systems the water quality/corrosiveness is different\nfor each cooling circuit. The primary part is usually of poorer quality than the secondary part. In\nthis case, the primary part once again contains brackish water and the secondary part demin-\nwater.\nMaterial selection for primary circulation cooling system\nThe materials for the primary system, filled with brackish water, are described in Section IV.2.\nThe heat exchanger between the primary and secondary system is extremely important for\noperation. Failure of this heat exchanger has serious consequences, so this should be taken into\naccount when selecting the materials for it. If the primary cooling agent is brackish water, then\nthe best choice for the tubes or plates (plate exchanger) is titanium. Other high-quality alloys\nsuch as 254 SMO or better can be considered in certain cases, but in most cases titanium is the\nbest choice.\nSelection of material for secondary circulation system\nEssential for a closed secondary system is that making the water oxygen free prevents corrosion.\nIn this case, demin water has been chosen as the cooling medium. However, in an aerated state,\nthis demin water is extremely corrosive for carbon steel. This can be suppressed by alkalising\nthe water (pH=9). Clean tap water with a relatively high chlorine content is, in principle, just as\ngood as demin water.\nIf these provisions are present, then the water is 'dead', which means its corrosiveness is\nminimal. In principle, all materials, including the tubes in heat exchangers, pumps and tubes\nfines, can be made from carbon steel. The conditions in the process must naturally be taken into\naccount.\nIt is important that the concentration of oxygen in these systems is checked regularly. In some\ncases, nitrates are used as an inhibitor in these systems. By keeping the water alkaline and/or\ntreating it with nitrates, leaking in of oxygen is less critical.\n\nAnnex IV\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nIV.4 \nOpen recirculating cooling systems\nIV.4.1 Fresh water application in open wet cooling tower\nWith respect to the application of material, one of the objectives in the design of an open\nrecirculating cooling system (open wet cooling tower) is to condition the water in the system in\nsuch a way (inhibitors, pH control, etc.), that use of carbon steel for most parts of the system is\neconomically acceptable.\nThis case is based on tap water. Depending on the composition and the cycles of concentration,\nthe concentration of components in this water will increase (sometimes called 'thickening'),\nwhereby the number of dissolved salts rises proportionally, which increases corrosiveness. With\ninhibitors and the right pH levels, this effect is suppressed. The design of such a system is\nusually based on the fact that the water is not corrosive for carbon steel.\nMost parts, such as tubes and pumps, are therefore made of carbon steel. The tubes in a heat\nexchanger are also often made of carbon steel. In critical systems or to provide more security,\nthe tubes are also often made of aluminium brass. Problems usually arise when the medium to\nbe cooled is corrosive. In very many cases, austenitic steel or a better alloy must then be used,\nwith the same risks as indicated above, for instance pitting or stress corrosion.\nIt is extremely important that pollution is kept to a minimum. This applies, in principle, to all\ncooling water systems. In an open circulation cooling system, 'side-stream' filtration is often\nused, or in critical coolers (condensers) a self-cleaning system (for instance with rubber balls) is\ninstalled.\nIV.4.2 Salt water application in open wet cooling towers\n[tm110, BDAG, 1995]\nThe use of salt or brackish water in cooling towers requires applications that particularly pay\nattention to corrosion of metal materials. A number of observations can be summarised. For salt\nwater resistant structures good experience has been gained with hardwood species and pressure\ntreated wood. However, the latter are done with CCA and cannot be regarded as an\nenvironmentally sound method. Sulphate resisting cement for concrete constructions and\nreinforcements for external and interior elements are well proven. Silicon, Aluminium Bronze\nand/or Stainless Steel can be applied, but coated galvanised only above water distribution level.\nPlastic coatings are recommended on Aluminium/Silicon bronze items.\nFill materials should be open low fouling with a high load capacity, where combinations of film\n(upper parts) and non-film (lower parts) have shown to be effective. Water velocity should be\nlow enough to prevent corrosion, but sufficiently high to prevent settlement of heavy solids.\nThese particular measures amongst others can reduce water treatment requirements in salt-water\napplications.\n\nAnnex V\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nANNEX V \nOVERVIEW \nOF \nCHEMICALS \nFOR \nTHE\nCONDITIONING OF COOLING WATER SYSTEMS\nIn all water-cooled systems additives are applied to treat the cooling water with the aim to\nprotect the cooling system and to avoid a reduction of heat exchange due to scaling, fouling and\ncorrosion. A wide range of additives is applied against these cooling water problems. The\nAnnex gives an overview of the different types of additives that are applied in the different wet\ncooling systems. In the final section, treatment of cooling water in a wet open cooling tower is\nexplained to illustrate the complexity of cooling water conditioning and the elements that are in\nplay.\nV.1 \nCorrosion inhibitors\nV.1.1 Corrosion\nCorrosion can be defined as the destruction of a metal by chemical or electrochemical reaction\nwith its environment. The result is a metal oxide or other salt having little structural ability,\nwhich causes damage to the material. In cooling systems, corrosion causes two basic problems.\nThe first and most obvious is the failure of equipment with the resultant cost of replacement and\nplant downtime. The second is decreased plant efficiency due to loss of heat transfer, which is\nthe result of heat exchanger fouling caused by the accumulation of corrosion products.\nCorrosion is caused or favoured by the presence of oxygen, the salt content, formation of\ndeposits, or an excessive low pH level.\nCorrosion can also result from fouling by the growth of organism, so called micobiologically-\ninfluenced corrosion (MIC): acid producing bacteria cause corrosion and vibrating mussels\ncause erosion.\nV.1.2 Applied corrosion inhibitors\nCorrosion inhibitors can be identified by their function. They remove corrosive material,\npassivate, precipitate or adsorb it. Passivating (anodic) inhibitors form a protective oxide film\non the metal surface. Precipitating (cathodic) inhibitors are simply chemicals, which form\ninsoluble precipitates that can coat and protect the surface. Adsorption inhibitors have polar\nproperties, which cause them to be adsorbed on the surface of the metal.\nThe use of corrosion inhibitors varies from system to system. In once-through systems\npolyphosphates and zinc are applied and there is limited use of silicates and molybdates. In\nsome countries hardly any corrosion inhibitors are dosed in once-through systems except for\nyellow metal inhibitors (e.g. ferrosulphate) dosed in copper alloy heat exchangers or\ncondensers.\nIn open recirculating systems normally a more comprehensive corrosion control programme is\nrequired. For many years chromate based programmes were used, but due to its toxicity the use\nhas been reduced significantly and should not be used anymore as there are good alternatives..\nMost current used corrosion programmes are based on phosphates, and zinc is added if water\nconditions require this. Often is chosen to operate the system under alkaline conditions (pH of\n8-9), but biocide and dispersant treatments might have to be adjusted accordingly under these\ncircumstances. Water is then inherently less corrosive. Disadvantage of alkaline operation is the\nincreased potential to scaling. Alkaline conditions in combination with organic phosphonates\nare effective against corrosion and scaling.\nTheoretically, closed water systems should not require corrosion inhibitors. Any oxygen\nintroduced with the initial make-up water should soon be depleted by oxidation of system\n\nAnnex V\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nmetals, after which corrosion should no longer occur. However, closed systems usually lose\nenough water and leak enough air to require corrosion protection. Another theory is that the\nhigh residence time of the water, up to several months, is responsible for the heavy treatment\nwith corrosion inhibitors. For closed systems the three most reliable corrosion inhibitors are\nchromate, molybdate, and nitrite materials. Generally, the chromate or molybdate have proven\nto be superior treatments. The toxicity of chromate restricts the use, particularly when a system\nmust be drained. In many cases a non-chromate alternative is available, but in some member\nstates their use is still permitted. Molybdate treatments provide effective corrosion protection\nand are seen as more environmental acceptable as chromate treatments.\nFinally, it depends on the systems conditions (materials used and pH) what kind of corrosion\ninhibitors is best applicable. For instance the most effective corrosion inhibitors for copper are\nthe aromatic azoles. Concentrations in evaporative recirculating cooling systems typically range\nfrom 2 to 20 mg/l as active compound. For some anodic inhibitors (such as chromates,\nmolybdates and nitrites) concentrations used in the past are reported to be 500 to 1000 mg/l. in\nclosed systems.\nV.2 \nScale inhibitors\nV.2.1 Scaling\nIf concentration of salt in the water film within the heat exchanger exceeds its solubility,\nprecipitation occurs, which is referred to as scaling. The main forms of scale are calcium\ncarbonate and calcium phosphate, but also calcium sulphate, silicates, Zn and Mg deposition can\noccur depending on the minerals contained in the water. Scaling reduces the performance of the\nheat exchanger, since the thermal conductivity of calcium carbonate is about 25 times lower\nthan that of steel. Scaling depends on three major factors: mineralisation (alkalinity), higher\ntemperature and pH of the circulating water and of secondary factors: presence of complexing\norganic matters and chemical composition of the heat exchanger surfaces. Also, certain shape of\nthe heat exchanger body favour scaling. Corrugations, oblique channels and an insufficient ratio\nof water flow per film surface area favour scaling. In recirculating systems high cycles of\nconcentration can lead to scaling as well.\nScaling may cause problems in cooling towers, as the film fill can be very susceptible to various\ntypes of deposition. Because of evaporation (1.8% of the circulation per 10K of cooling) in the\ntower, minerals and organic substances in the recirculating water may concentrate to such a\nlevel that scaling can occur.\nFor power stations in particular, it was reported that scaling occurs due to:\n• \nheating of the water up to 30ºC in direct cooling and 45ºC in tower assisted circuits,\n• \nevaporation of water to affect cooling in passage through the cooling towers, which gives\nrise to concentration of the dissolved salt up to a factor of 1.6 or as high as the concentration\nfactor determines, and\n• \nthe losses of free carbon dioxide during passage of water through the towers causing a rise\nin the pH which varies with the flow rate and the type of packing. With older timber statted\npacks the pH was 7.5-7.8, but with plastic film flow pack, this increases to 8.2-8.4 in small\ntowers (250 MWe) as well as in large towers (900 MWe or larger).\nV.2.2 Applied scale inhibition\nScale formation can play a role in once-through and open recirculating cooling systems. In\nclosed recirculating systems it should not be a major issue. It can occur if spills require frequent\nadditions of make-up water and depending on the factors mentioned above.\n\nAnnex V\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nThe increase of concentration of salts in cooling water in open recirculating cooling systems\nand distribution systems is caused by evaporation in the cooling tower and to be controlled by\nthe blowndown. The ratio of particulate solute in the recirculating water to that in the make-up\nwater is called concentration factor. The concentration factor ranges from as low as 2-3 for\nlarge power plants until 8-9 for some recirculating industrial cooling water systems. Typical\nconcentration factors in industry (not power plants) range between 3 and 5.\nIn practice, scaling is controlled by adjustment of the pH value by dosing of acid and by the\napplication of scale inhibitors. Experiences in large systems of power stations equipped with\ncooling towers show that treatment with acid (sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid) does not lead\nto a change in pH, which remains alkaline. The acids rather neutralize the alkalinity to avoid the\nprecipitation of CaCO3.\nHowever, in decarbonated waters pH control can be done by addition of acids. Decarbonation\nby precipitation of calcium carbonates depends on three major factors, which are mineralisation\n(alkalinity), temperature, and pH of the circulating water. Secondary factors are presence of\ncomplexing organic matters in water and the chemical composition of the heat exchanger\nsurfaces.\nThree alternatives were reported for the chemical treatment of cooling water to avoid scaling in\nheat exchangers and wet cooling towers in large wet cooling systems :\n• \ndecarbonation of make-up water (resulting in a sludge to be disposed of)\n• \naddition of acid\n• \naddition of organic scale inhibitors\nThe most important scale control agents are polyphosphates, phosphonates, polyacrylates, co-\npolymers and ter-polymers. Typical concentrations of scale control agents range from 2 to 20\nmg/l, as active compound. Hardness stabilisers prevent the formation of crystals and are used in\nrecirculating systems, but rarely or never in once-through systems.\nClosed recirculating systems are not subject to scale formation in the primary system except\nwhen hard make-up water must be used. Many closed systems use zeolite-softened water or\ncondensates as make-up water to prevent scale problems. Generally, some corrosion occurs due\nto loss of water or leakage of air. In the secondary cooling circuit water circulates in an open\nevaporative system. Here corrosion can occur on the outside of the coils where wet heat transfer\ntakes place.\nV.3 \nFouling inhibitors (dispersants)\nV.3.1 Fouling\nFouling occurs when insoluble organic particulates suspended in water of both once-through\nand open recirculating cooling systems form deposits on the systems’ surface. Particulate\nmatter, particle sizes and low water velocities are factors that enhance fouling. Foulants can be\nsand, silt, iron oxides and other corrosion products and they can react with some water treatment\nchemicals as well. They can either be airborne, can enter the cooling system with the water (silt,\nclay) or are introduced by process leaks and can be very finely dispersed with sizes as small as\n1-100 nm.\nDispersants are polymers used to prevent fouling by removing particulate (organic) matter (e.g.\nmicrofouling and slime layer) from the heat exchanger surface by increasing the electric charge\nresulting from absorption The particles repel each other and as a result remain suspended. To\nfacilitate penetration of biocides into microfouling and slime layers surfactants often referred to\nas biodispersants can be used. Dispersants help to keep the surface of heat exchangers clean,\nthereby reducing the risk of corrosion. It is common practice to dose biocides in combination\nwith dispersants at levels of 1-10 mg/l as active ingredient.\n\nAnnex V\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nV.3.2 Applied fouling inhibitors\nThe most effective and widely used dispersants are low molecular weight anionic polymers. The\nmost important dispersants are: organic and metal sulphonates, metal phenolate, metal dialkyl\ndithiophosphanates, sodium dialkyl sulphosuccinates, polyethylene alkyl and alicyclic amines,\nand monoethanolamine phosphate salts, polyacrylates, polymetacrylates and acrylate based\npolymers.\nV.4 \nBiocides\nV.4.1 Biofouling\nEntrainment of organisms through water or air may lead to biofouling. Biofouling is generally\nof two main types: macrofouling (e.g. mussels) and microfouling (e.g. bacteria, funghi, algae).\nMacrofouling is generally confined to once-through systems and is more severe in marine and\nbrackish water than in fresh water. Macrofouling may cause gross blockage of pipework and\nculverts, and may cause so-called erosion corrosion. Macrofouling is very much location and\nwater quality specific, both in terms of quantity and species variety.\nMicrofouling related problems occur both in once-through and open recirculating cooling\nsystems. Microbial growth on wetted surfaces leads to the formation of biofilms. The result of\nuncontrolled microbial growth on surfaces is slime formation. The biological component or\nbiofilm is produced by the living cells and their metabolic by-products. Microfouling is always\nthe primary coloniser of surfaces in the development of biofouling.\nThe predominant effect of biofouling is reduction of heat transfer capacity of the heat\nexchangers and energy losses due to increased frictional resistance. Furthermore, where an\nexposed metal becomes fouled microbial induced corrosion can occur. In addition microbial\nspecies may threaten human health by spreading via cooling towers.\nA number of antifouling techniques and treatments are available. These applications, the type of\ncooling water and the associated water problems are summarised in Table V.1.\n\nAnnex V\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable V.1: Survey of fouling and clogging organisms, and degree of fouling in marine, brackish and\nfresh water.

On biocides, their use and their effects, a lot of research has been done and a large\nnumber of publications can be found.\nBiocides are substances that slow down the microbiological growth in the cooling water, reduce\nthe total number of cells in the feedwater and weaken stability of the biofilm matrix, and\nthereby minimising organic pollution in the cooling system. Microbiological growth includes\nthe development of micro-organisms, bacteria, algae and fungi, and also the developments of\nmacro-organisms, such as oysters, barnacles and mussels.\nGenerally, biocides are defined as either oxidising biocides or non-oxidising biocides.\nOxidising biocides have a non-specific broad-spectrum biocidal mode of action, which limits\nthe degree to which fouling organisms can develop resistance to these biocides. Non-oxidising\nbiocides are more selective and more complex in their working and therefore need a longer\nreaction time than oxidising biocides.\nThe environmental problem of biocides, however, is their inherent toxicity. Some antimicrobials\nused in cooling systems are compounds that rapidly break down in water, thereby alleviating\nsome potential environmental hazards. This chemical breakdown is often accompanied by a\nreduction in the toxicity of the compound. The compound can be added to the cooling water\nsystem, accomplish its task of killing the microbes in the system and then break down into less\ntoxic chemicals.\nThe consumption of biocides is determined by the type of cooling system, the water resource\n(fresh or salt), the season and leakage of organic materials from the process and the systems\nhalf-time. In once-through systems almost solely biocides are used. Usually, these are\noxidative biocides such as hypochlorite or derivatives as hypobromite.\nIn open recirculating cooling systems use of biocides is made on the basis of an oxidative\nbiocide alone or in combination with a non-oxidative biocide. The consumption of non-\noxidative biocides and other conditioning agents is almost completely determined by\nrecirculating cooling water systems. Furthermore, it has been observed that in some closed\nrecirculating systems no biocides are being added at all.\nTable V.2 gives an indication of the amounts of biocides used in some European Member\nStates.\nV.4.3 Oxidising biocides\nThe oxidising biocides commonly used in industrial cooling systems are the halogens, chlorine\nand bromine, in liquid and gaseous form, organic halogen donors, chlorine dioxide and ozone,\nmonochloramine and peroxides. In case of seawater conditions there is a growing interest in the\napplication of chlorine dioxide, because of its effectiveness and the reduced formation of\nbromated \nhydrocarbons \n(in \nparticular \nbromoforme, \nchlorodibromomethane,\nbromodichloromethane and dibromoacetonitrile) and trihalomethanes (THM) compared to\nhypochlorite, but on the other hand it produces ClO3\n- ions.\nChlorine gas (Cl2) is also used in some places being compact and cheap, but has a safety risk\nwhen stored in bulk and gives some difficulties in handling.\nSodium hypochlorite is the most commonly oxidising biocide used in large once-through\nsystems. It can be produced on marine sites by electrolysis of seawater. This process, called\nelectrochlorination, avoids the transport and storage of dangerous chlorine gas or solution.\nThe consumption of sodium hypochlorite as active chlorine demand is generally lower in and\naround saltwater systems than on freshwater systems, because of a higher level of dissolved and\nparticulate organic matter in fresh water. Due to its higher bromide content, the formation of\n\nAnnex V\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nhalogenated organics in seawater is reported to be lower than in freshwater (rivers), but no\npublications could confirm this.\nTable V.2: Estimated consumption levels of some commonly used oxidising biocides in a few\nEuropean Member States\n(kg/yr) (KEMA, 1996)\nGroup\nOxidising biocides\nUnited Kingdom\n(1993)2\nNetherlands\n(1995)3\nFrance\n(1998)\nChlorine\nbased\nSodium hypochlorite\n7310001,5\n\n\nSodium\ndichloroisocyanurate\n\nChlorine dioxide\n\nBromine\nbased\nSodium bromide\n\n\n1-bromo-3-chloro-5,5-\ndimethylhydanthoide\n(BCDMH)\n\n\nOther\nHydrogen peroxide\n\nPeracetic acid\n\nNotes:\n1 estimated use as active ingredient, (as formulated product the amounts are much higher)\n2 in all cooling water systems\n3 only in recirculating systems\n4 measured as Cl2\n5 this figure is an underestimation as in the U.K much electrochlorination is employed in most coastal power stations\n6 in Cl2 produced by electrochlorination at fossil fuel power stations\nThis will also hold for cooling systems using water from heavily polluted harbours. Continuous\n‘low” chlorination is often preferred, although discontinuous or semi-continuous chlorination is\nmore and more practised. However, this requires more intensive monitoring of the cooling\nsystem and the cooling water.\nFrom both the chlorine gas and the sodium hypochlorite solution, the most active chemical\nspecies is the non-dissociated hypochlorous acid. This is a very reactive oxidising agent and\nreacts with most organics in the water to form the trihalomethane (THM) chloroform (3-5%)\nand other chlorinated organics. Free chlorine can also react with ammonia to produce\nchloramines or with diverse dissolved organic compounds forming different types of\norganohalogenated compounds (such as THM, chlorophenols). This occurs in the cooling\nsystem itself also and not before this first chlorine demand has been met, the residual chlorine\nwill be able to do its biocidal work.\nThe use of the oxidising biocide hypobromous acid (HOBr) could be an alternative to\nhypochlorite. The hypobromous acid remains undissociated at higher pH values than is valid for\nhypochlorous acid. This implies that at pH 8 and above the free oxidant HOBr is a more\nefficient biocide than the dissociated hypochlorous ion OCl- . As a consequence, in alkaline\nfreshwater, the effective dosage of hypobromite can be much lower than the equivalent\nhypochlorite. Although, brominated organics are 2-3 times more toxic than the chlorinated\nequivalents, they decompose more rapid and given the lower demand could provide a distinct\nenvironmental advantage. However, in marine water, the oxidation of bromide ions by\nhypochlorite leads to a rapid formation of hypobromite and the chlorination of sea water is\nalmost equivalent to the bromination and there may be little environmental benefit in the\nhypobromous option compared with the hypochlorous option.\n\nAnnex V\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nBromide and sodium hypochlorite, chloramine and peroxyde are used in combination in\nrecirculating systems, which is also expected to give less environmentally hazardous substances.\nA disadvantage of this treatment could be that at high concentrations of free oxidant (FO)\nsolutions the formation of carcinogenous bromate could occur. Another possible source can be\nthe ozonation of natural waters by the oxidation of bromide ions.\nThe bromate content depends on the bromide concentration in the brine water used to produce\nsodium hypochlorite. The theoretical maximum bromate concentration (BrO3\n-) in sodium\nhypochlorite solutions produced by electrolysis of seawater is around 100 mg/l or 3 mg per g of\nchlorine. A wide range of bromate concentration is found in commercial hypochlorite solutions.\nIf concentrated brines are used for chlorine production it varies from 0.15 to 4.0 mg BrO3\n- per g\nof chlorine.\nV.4.4 Non-oxidising biocides\nNon-oxidising biocides are comparatively slow reacting substances that react with specific cell\ncomponents or reaction pathways in the cell. The following non-oxidising biocides are reported\nto be commonly used: 2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilopropionamide (DBNPA), glutaric aldehyde,\nquaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), isothiazolones, halogenated bisphenols and\nthiocarbamates, but many others are in the market and within Europe the amount and the\nfrequency of use of the individual biocide varies considerably. Table V.3 gives an indication of\nthe consumption of some non-oxidizing biocides.\nThe application of non-oxidising biocides instead of oxidising biocides is recommended only in\ncases where oxidising biocides are not able to give sufficient protection, such as in systems with\nhigh organic loads, or in recirculating wet cooling systems where daily control is not a practice.\nIn large recirculating wet cooling systems, where mostly sodium hypochlorite is used,\nsometimes constant monitoring is applied to ensure that the correct level of free oxidants is\navailable in the circuit. For many smaller recirculating wet cooling systems however, and for\nthose operated by water service companies who do not have personnel permanently on-site,\napplication of non-oxidising biocides that are less influenced by the water quality are preferred\nover the oxidising biocides [tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996].\nNon-oxidising biocides are mainly applied in open evaporative recirculating cooling systems.\nGenerally, they are applied to cooling water systems to give water active ingredient\nconcentrations from about 0.5 ppm up to 50 ppm (exceptionally 100 ppm).\nNon-oxidising biocides exert their effects on micro-organisms by reaction with specific cell\ncomponents or reaction pathways in the cell. The first reaction involves damage to the cell\nmembrane and in the other reaction damage is being done to the biochemical machinery in the\nenergy production or energy utilisation of the cell.\nQuaternary ammonium compounds are cationic surface-active molecules. They damage the cell\nmembranes of bacteria, fungi and algae, thus increasing the permeability of the cell wall\nresulting in denaturation of proteines and finally death of the cell. Isothiazolones are non-\nspecific and they interfere with ATP-syntheses in the cell. Of the others methylene(bis)thio-\ncyanate (MBT) is widely used against bacteria and fungi and this biocide is believed to bind\nirreversibly to biomolecules preventing necessary reduction and oxidation reactions.\nGlutaraldehyde is used against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and its biocidal activity is\nbased on protein cross-linking.\n\nAnnex V\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nTable V.3: Estimated consumption levels in some of European Member States of some commonly\nused non-oxidising biocides in kg/yr\n(KEMA, 1996)\nGroup\nNon-oxidising biocides\nUnited Kingdom\n(1993)2\nNetherlands\n(1995)3\nFrance\n(1998)\nQAC\nDimethyl cocobenzyl\nAmmonium chloride\n\nBezyl-alkonium ammonium\ncompounds\n\nTotal QAC estimate\n\nIsothia-\nzolines\n5-chloro-2-methyl-4-\nisothiazolin-3-one\n\nTotal isothiazolines\n\n\nHalogenated bisphenols\n(dichlorophen+fentichlor)\n\nThiocarbamates\n\nOthers\nGlutaraldehyde\n\n\nTetraalkyl \nphosphonium\nchloride\n\n2,2-dibromo-3-nitrilo-\npropionamide\n\n\nMethylene(bis)thio-cyanate\n(MBT)\n\n\nß-bromo-ß-nitrostyrene\n(BNS)\n\n\nFatty amines\n\nOthers\n\nEstimated total\n\n\nNotes:\n1 estimated use as active ingredient (as formulated product the amounts are much higher)\n2 in all cooling water systems\n3 only in recirculating systems\n4 active product used at a marine fossil fuel power station\nV.4.5 Factors determining the use of biocides.\n[tm005, Van Donk and Jenner, 1996]\nThe following factors focus on the use of biocides, but could be applied to the use of other\nadditives as well.\n• \nEffectiveness\nObvious as this may sound, a biocide has to be effective in the specific situation it is used in.\nHowever, it is important to realise that a biocide - or a cooling water treatment program - that is\neffective in one system, may not be so in another system, even if these systems are apparently\nidentical. One of the reasons for this can be the development of a resistant or tolerant population\nof micro-organisms. For oxidising biocides this is less of a risk than for non-oxidising biocides.\n• \nSystem type\nThe system type determines the hydraulic half-time of the cooling water in the wet cooling\nsystems, and thus the contact time between the biocide and the cooling water. In once-through\nwet cooling systems, where residence times are short, fast reacting - oxidising - biocides are\ngenerally used. At present if biocides are being used in once-through systems in the Netherlands\nsodium hypochlorite is applied. Slower reacting non-oxidising biocides are at present only used\n\nAnnex V\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nin recirculating wet cooling systems. The majority (> 90%) of the recirculating cooling water\nsystems is being treated with NaOCl, Cl2, ClO2 or NaOCl./NaBr.\nThe type of process is an important factor in the choice of a biocide, especially when\nconsidering the reactivity of some biocides with process fluids spilled into the cooling water.\nSome processes, like the direct cooling of metal in the metal industry create special conditions\nin the cooling water. Process fluids leaking into the cooling water may function as a nutrient for\nbiological growth.\n• \nWater quality\nChemical and biological water quality affects the choice of a cooling water treatment\nprogramme, and thus the choice of a biocide. Occurrence of macrofouling organisms is very\nmuch water quality related. Generally speaking, an increased quality of the surface water in\nbiological terms may result in an increased occurrence of macrofouling in wet cooling systems.\nFor micro-organisms, water type does not play a major role in defining the types of organisms\nencountered. In theory a pH value of approximately 7 is optimal for microbial growth. Acid\nconditions will favour growth of fungi and pH values higher than 8 will reduce algae growth.\nHowever, in practice micro-organisms prove to be highly adaptable and can colonise a variety\nof systems. An illustration of this is the commonly held belief that fungi prefer acidic to neutral\nmedia for growth, and will be supplanted by bacteria in an alkaline system. This is\nfundamentally correct, but if such a system is treated with a bactericide with no antifungal\nactivity, often contamination with fungal spores allows colonisation of the system, even at a pH\nvalue of 9.\nIn once-through systems, the pH value inside the cooling system is equal to that of the entrained\nwater, although dosing of sodium hypochlorite may slightly increase the pH value but this is\nusually impossible to measure. In open evaporative recirculating systems the pH value is often\ncontrolled, ranging generally from 7 to 9, by addition of acids (often sulphuric acid) or a base\n(often sodium hydroxide) or cycling natural alkalinity.\nFor the application of sodium hypochlorite and sodium hypobromite as a biocide, it is well\nknown that the pH value strongly influences the equilibrium between hypohalous acid and the\nhypohalite ion. Hypohalous acids are approximately hundred times more toxic than their anionic\nform. Therefore, in theory, the pH value will affect the toxicity of for example hypochlorite\ndose.\nIn practice, the pH value cannot be influenced in once-through systems. Freshwater once-\nthrough systems typically use cooling water at pH 7 - 8; seawater cooled systems operate at a\npH value of approximately pH 8. The above-mentioned equilibrium is therefore most relevant\nfor the effectiveness of the treatment in once-through systems, since residence time of the\ncooling water - and thus contact time of the biocide with the organisms - in the cooling system\nis relatively short.\nWet recirculating systems generally are operated at a pH value ranging from 7 - 9. Experience\nin the chemical industry has shown that a recirculating system operating at pH value of 9 uses\nless hypochlorite than a system operating at a lower pH value, without loss of effectiveness of\nthe treatment. The fate of hypochlorite in recirculating systems has been extensively studied.\nThe main conclusion from this is that 5-10% of the hypochlorite dosed is lost in the tower when\noperating at pH value of 8.5, while at a pH value of lower than 7 this is 30 - 40%.\nThe explanation for this is that the hypochlorite anion cannot be stripped out of the cooling\ntower. This is in contrast with hypohalous acid. It is concluded that hypochlorite dosage at a pH\nvalue of 9 is equally effective, in spite of the fact that only (1 - 5%) is present in the acid form,\nbecause the hypohalous acid consumed will be instantly replenished from the surplus present in\nthe anionic form. The overall conclusion therefore is that operating recirculating systems at a\nhigh pH value will reduce the amount of hypochlorite needed for effective microfouling control.\n\nAnnex V\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe temperature of the surface influences the growth of the marine biology and can therefore be\nused as a factor for the choice of a treatment programme in once-through cooling systems.\nMacrofouling in once-through systems in the Netherlands will not grow rapidly during winter\nmonths. Therefore it is not necessary to dose biocides when water temperatures are lower than\n12°C. Industries with once-through systems on the Mediterranean coast, where severe\nmacrofouling growth and spat fall take place all year round, dose oxidising biocides all year\nround. In general, water temperature will greatly affect species variability, growth rate and\nbiocide demand. In once-through systems the water temperature added to the bulk water (∆T) is\n8 - 12 °C, restricted by a maximum discharge temperature. Recirculating systems face the same\nrestriction at the point of discharge, although sometimes higher discharge temperatures are\nallowed. Temperatures in the recirculating bulk water can be 20 - 30 °C and higher. Most\nmacrofouling species in the Netherlands do not tolerate long-term exposure to temperatures of\n30 °C, but some species, such as the brackish water mussel, grow very rapidly at these\ntemperatures.\nFor recirculating systems with high concentration factors, the hardness of the intake water and\nthe amount of organic materials are of extreme importance, since this will affect the amount of\nscaling and corrosion inhibitors needed. Both for once-through and recirculating systems the\namounts of organic material (dissolved solids, suspended solids) in the cooling water are\nimportant, since they influence biocide demand. The extent into which this influences biocides\nvaries (e.g. hypochlorite will react with ammonia, chlorine dioxide will not). In general it is\nadvisable to reduce to a minimum all substances that lead to increased biocide demand.\nV.4.6 Interactions with other water treatment chemicals\nOther additives such as corrosion and scale inhibitors can also affect the choice of a suitable\nbiocide. Some biocides limit each other’s effectiveness, but can also be of reciprocal benefit.\nFor example:\n- \nQACs are known to be partially neutralised by oxidative biocides and anionic\ndispersing agents;\n- \nIsothiazolones on the other hand are stabilised by sodium hypochlorite;\n- \nOzone is such a strong oxidant that it will oxidise almost any other cooling water\nadditive, which is specifically a problem for corrosion inhibitors that often have to be\napplied to some extent adjacent to the ozone application to protect the equipment.\nV.5 \nCycles of concentration and water balance\nThe application of additives in open evaporative cooling towers is complex and largely related\nto the water balance and the cycles of concentration with which the system is operated. The\nblowdown is an important measure to correct the solids balance and plays a role in the\noptimisation of cooling systems performance and cooling water treatment. A short explanation\nof the principle of blowdown is given below Figure V.1.\nA quantity of cooling water (Qc) is circulating through the system in m3 per minute. Passing the\nheat exchanger the cooling water is cooled down in the cooling tower by evaporation and\nconvection. Evaporation (E), drift, windage and some leakage reduce the amount of cooling\nwater and consequently the concentration of salts in the water increases which could lead to\nscaling and corrosion.\n\nAnnex V\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFigure V.1: Tower and solids balances for an evaporative cooling system using a cooling tower\n[tm135, Anonymous, 1988]\nThis is balanced by bleeding the system, which process is called blowdown (B with\nconcentration Cb) and compensated by adding water called make-up (M with concentration Cm).\nAs the system has to be balanced use is made of the concentration ratio (CR): CR = M/B =\nCb/Cm (because M x Cm = B x Cb).\nFigure V.2: Reduction of the make-up flow by concentration in an evaporative cooling system\n[tm135, Nalco, 1988]\n\nAnnex V\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nM = E+B, thus CR = (E+B)/B= E/B+1 and from this equation follows that\nThis is a very useful equation in cooling water treatment. After the cycles of concentration have\nbeen determined based upon the make-up and blowdown concentrations, the actual blowdown\nbeing lost from the system, or the blowdown required to maintain the system at the desired\nnumber of cycles, can be calculated.\nB = E/(CR-1)\n\nAnnex VI\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nANNEX VI \nEXAMPLE \nOF \nLEGISLATION \nIN \nEUROPEAN\nMEMBER STATES\nThe following text has been integrally included to give an example of legislation that has been\nsuccessfully applied in Europe to reduce the emissions of cooling systems.\nGeneral Administrative Regulation of 31 January 1994\nOn the Amendment to the\nGeneral Administrative Framework Regulation on\nMinimum Requirements for the Discharge of Waste Water into Waters\n(currently,august 2000,being revised)\nExcerpt of\nAppendix 31: Water Treatment, Cooling Systems, Steam Generation\n\nScope\n1.1\nWaste water in which the contaminant load originates primarily from the treatment of\nwater from cooling systems of industrial processes.\n\nRequirements\nThe following requirements for the discharge of waste water must be complied with.\nThe requirements for chemical oxygen demand, for nitrogen as the sum of ammonium,\nnitrite and nitrate nitrogen, for inorganic phosphorus compounds and for filterable\nsubstances are based on generally recognised technical rules, the remaining require-\nments on best available technology.\nThese requirements shall not apply to waste water discharges of less than 0.5 m3 per\nday.\n2.1\nGeneral requirements\nThe waste water must not contain - with the exception of phosphonates and poly-\ncarboxylates - any organic complexing agents which are not readily biodegradable in\naccordance with the basic level requirements of the Chemicals Act for determining\nready biodegradability by means of the OECD Guidelines 301 A - 301 E of May 1981.\nThe waste water must not contain chromium compounds or mercury compounds,\nnitrite, organometallic compounds (metal-carbon bonds) or mercaptobenzothiazole\noriginating from the use of operating and ancillary resources.\nThe requirements in the first and second paragraphs shall be deemed to be complied\nwith if the substances specified are not used, all operating and ancillary resources used\nare listed in an operating journal and manufacturers' information is available showing\nthat such substances are neither present in the operating and ancillary resources used\nnor capable of forming under operating conditions.\n\nAnnex VI\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n2.3\nRequirements for waste water from cooling systems\n2.3.1\nWater from single-pass or open-ended fresh water cooling systems\nThe requirements after shock treatment with microbicidal substances shall be as fol-\nlows:\nQualified random sample or\n2-hour composite sample (mg/l)\nChlorine dioxide, chlorine and bromine\n(expressed as chlorine)\n0.2\nAdsorbable organic halogens (AOX)\n0.15\nMicrobicidal substances other than hydrogen peroxide and ozone must not be present\nin the waste water.

The concept specifies measures of\nmonitoring and changeover in connection with once-through cooling systems and alternatives to\nonce-through cooling systems as a function of the persistence of water pollution by substances,\nwhich can be discharged into the cooling water.\nThe capacity of a substance to cause long-term detrimental changes or to pose a hazard to a\nwater body can be determined on the basis of the R - phrases established under European\nlegislation on hazardous substances. A certain score is allocated, as shown in the table below, to\neach of the R - phrases relating to the protected assets aquatic-environment as well as human\nhealth and soil. The scores of all R - phrases assigned to the substance concerned are added up\nto obtain the total score. This total score is then linked with the required safety measure\nconcerning the contaminated cooling water. Decisions relating to the implementation of such\nmeasures and the technology applied can, of course, only be taken within the individual\ncompanies concerned and with knowledge of the particular circumstances.\nIt will be recommended to apply this concept immediately to new plants and to refit existing\ncooling-systems if they do not meet these requirements within:\n- 5 years for substances with total score > 9\n- 8 years for substances with total score from 0 - 8\nFor substances with total score > 5 measures with regard to the monitoring of once-through\ncooling systems should be tackled immediately taking into account the requirements of\nindividual cases.\nThe requirements of this safety concept refer to all cooling water streams, which are not\nconnected to industrial purification plants or to an appropriate water-associated purification\nplant.

In this\nconnection it is sufficient that the analytical system provides trend data. The measurement of\nabsolute concentrations is not necessary for such systems, but merely the detection of deviations\nfrom normal states.\nMeasurement can either occur directly by sensors in the cooling water stream or via automatic\nsampling semi-continuously outside the cooling water stream.\nFor the following parameters and analytical methods, equipment is on the market which is\nappropriate for automatic monitoring of once-through cooling systems in the above sense. With\nregard to the selection of equipment for this function, the reliability of the system is generally\nmore important than increased demands on its accuracy.\nThe selection of the appropriate system is determined by the substance(s) released in connection\nwith a leakage and it is, moreover, strongly dependent on the special circumstances of\nindividual cases. In this connection it should first be checked whether the automatic analytical\nmonitoring can be carried out by means of a parameter or of an analytical method of the\nfollowing List 1.

CHEMICALS\nVIII.1 Benchmark assessment concept for cooling water\nchemicals\nVIII.1.1 \nIntroduction\nGeneral\nIt is well established that the cooling BREF is “horizontal” in nature, and that it is not possible\nto identify a “BAT cooling system” as such because so much is dependent on the specific\nprocess being cooled, and its location (especially climate, water supply etc.).\nTherefore, the approach to be taken in the BREF must be one of providing “tools” to help the\nMember State authorities rationalise what options are available, and select an optimal cooling\nsolution (both in terms of equipment, and “operating conditions”) which will represent BAT for\nIPPC permitting purposes.\nFirstly, in terms of “plant equipment”, such selections will mainly be made when new systems\nare built, but also in the context of upgrades or retrofitting of existing systems.\nSecondly, the “operating conditions” which are applied in both existing and new systems have\nbeen singled out for attention in discussions. A key element of these “conditions” relates to the\noptimisation of the cooling system in terms of efficiency and plant longevity through the use of\nchemicals. BAT-based optimisation decisions will need to be made in terms of what chemicals\nare used, and in what quantities, for permitting purposes.\nAn approach has been developed within the TWG for a simple so-called “benchmarking”\nmethod to help the Member States compare different chemicals one with another on the basis of\npotential environmental impact. Without such a tool, the complexity of making such decisions\ncould be a serious obstacle in determining what is BAT for cooling systems in a rational way at\nthe local level.\nAs is described below, most of the main elements for establishing such a risk-based\nbenchmarking tool can already be found in Community legislation and its official supporting\ndocumentation. The present approach seeks to draw together elements from: the IPPC Directive,\nthe Water Framework Directive, and Risk Assessment legislation and the supporting “Technical\nGuidance Document” in a coherent manner, to provide a tool to help evaluate cooling\nchemicals.\nVIII.1.1.1 \nBackground\nFrom its earliest meetings, the TWG agreed by consensus that any assessment of cooling water\nchemicals should involve both intrinsic properties and local situation characteristics (risk based\napproach).\nThe ensuing Benchmarking Assessment Concept arises as a result of consideration of existing\nassessment schemes and methodologies, and seeks to provide a starting point for proper\nconsideration of both intrinsic properties and the local level situation in the assessment of\ndifferent possible treatment regimes.\nThe assessment concept does not enter into a discussion of the Intrinsic Hazard Approach, but\nconcentrates on the task of explaining and clarifying the Benchmarking (relative ranking)\nProcedure.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nIt essentially focuses on individual substances, giving brief indications of how the method could\nbe extended to multi-substance complete chemical treatments.\nAlso, only the most complex case (and most frequent) of open recirculating systems (cooling\nsystems with an evaporative cooling tower) is dealt with, with the possibility of later extension\nto once-through, closed systems, etc.\nVIII.1.1.2 \nRelevant legislative background\nThere is no need, here, to evoke in any detail the legislative requirements which have led to the\ndevelopment of BAT reference documents. It is enough to mention Article 16.2 of the IPPC\nDirective on exchange of information, and the initiative of the Commission to develop, through\nthe institution of the Information Exchange Forum, a tool which should assist and guide\nMember States Authorities to set Emission Limit Values (ELV) for IPPC Listed Plants.\nIt is of importance, though, to underline one of the key aspects of the Directive: the control of\nemissions and their impact on the environment through a “combined” method of BAT set\nemission limit values to be checked against environmental quality standards.\nAlso very relevant in this context is the shortly to be adopted Water Framework Directive\n(WFD).\nAlthough it might be the case that a correct evaluation of the effects of chemical treatments used\nin cooling systems should be subject to a multimedia assessment, it is also correct to state that\nthe major concerns associated to the use of these chemicals regard the main potential receiver of\npolluting substances: the aquatic-environment.\nA few words are therefore necessary to briefly review the relevant parts of the WFD.\nVIII.1.1.3 \nThe water framework directive (WFD)\nWhile the WFD goes much further than providing elements to prevent and control emissions\nfrom Industrial IPPC Plants, it does in fact supply one key link with the IPPC Directive. It fixes\nmethods and procedures for the Commission to prioritize dangerous substances and to propose,\nfor these, emission controls and EQSs (Environmental Quality Standards; or “Quality\nStandards”), to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament.\nFurthermore it gives to the Member States the right and the duty to fix Quality Standards for\nany other substances that are relevant, in any River Basin, to the achievement of the objectives\nset by the Directive itself.\nMore important than this, it introduces in an annex (Annex V Section 1.2.6) a simple procedure\nto be used by the Member States Authorities to calculate Environmental Quality Standards\n(EQSs) for chemical substances in water.\nIn other words, it provides one of the conditions required by the IPPC Directive to implement a\ncombined approach: methods and procedures to calculate Quality Standards.\nAccording to the Water Framework Directive (WFD) text (Annex V Section 1.2.6), Member\nStates are to determine EQSs in the following way:\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTest Method\nSafety Factor\nAt least one acute L(E)C50 from each of three trophic levels of\nthe base-set\n\nOne chronic NOEC (either fish or daphnia or a representative\norganism from saline waters)\n\nTwo chronic NOECs from species representing two trophic\nlevels (fish and/or daphnia or a representative organism from\nsaline waters and/or algae)\n\nChronic NOECs from at least three species (normally fish,\ndaphnia or a representative organism for saline waters & algae)\nrepresenting three trophic levels\n\nOther cases, including field data or model ecosystems, which\nallow more precise safety factors to be calculated and applied.\nCase by case assessment\nWhile a more detailed analysis of the significance and implications of this table will be made\nlater, there are a few notes that need to be made at this point:\na)\nThe Quality Standards set on this basis only take into account the protection of the\naquatic system, without considering the indirect-human effects\nb)\nThe numbers resulting from the above table are Predicted No Effect Concentrations\n(PNEC) (See Technical Guidance Document for Regulation 793/93/EEC)\nc)\nThe Commission has developed a Prioritization Procedure, which is based on a system\nin which an aquatic effect score is combined with a bio-accumulation score and a\nhuman effect score. The procedure has been used to provide the basis for the\nCommission’s proposed “priority list” of substances to be controlled at EU level by\nmeans of emissions controls and EQSs to be adopted under the Water Framework\nDirective.\nThe following benchmarking assessment concept is also based on the above method of\nCalculating Quality Standards. This is for the following reasons:\n-\nin the context of the BREF, the method must be clear, simple straight forward,\ntransparent and easy to use\n-\nit is most probable, even if a lot of work is needed to prove this, that the aquatic-\nenvironment is the weakest link of the chain\n-\nthe benchmarking methods will be used in combination with EU chemicals legislation\n(Intrinsic Hazards), which, implicitly includes evaluation of potential indirect adverse\neffects (both on the aquatic-environment and on humans) through the inclusion of bio-\naccumulation, the CMT properties (carcinogenic, mutagenic, teratogenic) as well as\nchronic effects in the classification of hazardous chemicals.\nThe WFD also requires that Member States set EQS for waters intended for Drinking\nWater Abstraction: this will be another check point to take into account human health in\none of the most important exposure routes.\nVIII.1.2 \nBenchmarking : introduction of the concept\nThe Benchmarking Assessment Concept is founded on carrying out substance by substance\ncomparisons using a standardised theoretical measure of the Predicted Environmental\nConcentration (here in referred to as PECstandardised). This PECstandardised is compared with the\ncorresponding Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) or EQS of the substance, determined\nin accordance with the method contained in Annex V of the Water Framework Directive. In this\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nway a ration can be calculated for each substance which permits a preliminary ranking of\nsubstances based on potential impact.\nWhile the terms PNEC and PEC have now entered in the legislative language in the context of\nemissions law, and their significance will become common knowledge, it is worth at this point\nclarifying the concepts as they apply to the Benchmarking Procedure.\nVIII.1.2.1 \nThe PNEC\nThe Benchmarking Procedure does not attempt to rank the chemicals mentioned in the BREF\nitself.\nThe real-life situation is complicated by the fact that only rarely do chemical treatments for\ncooling systems consist of a single substance. The attempt to rank treatments in a BREF would\nimply the application of an “additive” procedure of some sort to an enormous list of possible\nsubstances combinations in the treatments. Assuming these combinations can be made\navailable, this would require a large quantity of work and time, and would almost certainly fail\nto be either exhaustive or up to date.\nTherefore, this Assessment Concept aims to offer a standard methodology, rather than a\nnumerical assessment of substances or treatments.\nThe Member State (MS) Authorities may then use this methodology as they see fit, at MS level,\nor better still at local level.\nAt any rate, aquatic toxicity data must be available and be made available by chemical suppliers\nto permit evaluations of PNECs. This is a fundamental aspect of any ranking procedure.\nIt is worth noting, also, that the Annex V procedure, and the related table, have not been\ninvented recently by the Commission in the context of the WFD. In fact the approach and the\ntable have been strictly derived from the Technical Guidance Document on the assessment of\nRisk for Existing and New Chemicals.\n(An extract of this pertinent portion is attached in VII.1.6 Appendix I).\nOnly a few words of clarification seem appropriate here.\nThe fewer data there are available the higher the assessment factor to be applied to convert\ntoxicity data to PNECs.\nThe availability of chronic data reduces the factor. Progressing through a set of intermediate\nsituations, having chronic data on three trophic levels allows the use of a factor of 10, compared\nto a factor of a 1000 when only acute toxicity data are available. The costs associated with\nperforming chronic tests are much higher than the costs for acute testing. Thus it is likely that\nmore acute than chronic toxicity data will be available.\nWhen the Benchmarking Procedure is applied locally, the available data will have to be used\ntogether with the corresponding assessment factor.\nIt will be left, in this case, to the supplier of chemicals to decide whether or not to invest\nadditional resources in obtaining chronic data, as and when this might prove necessary. For\nexample, for a given plant it could be the case that using only acute data (which implies\nobtaining an EQS by dividing the LC50 by a “safety factor” of 1000 to take account of\nuncertainty) there may be difficulty in complying with the stringent resultant EQS. In this case\nthe supplier might opt to obtain the more “certain”, but equally more time-consuming and more\ncostly, chronic data. Chronic data implies dividing test result concentrations by a safety factor of\nonly 10, which will lead to a more “certain” EQS, which may also be more achievable.\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nVIII.1.2.2 \nThe PEC\nThe “real” PEC, in the context of chemicals used in a cooling system, must be seen and defined\nas the final concentration of the chemical in the river water, after discharge and after dilution\nwith the river water at appropriate distance from the discharge.\nWhen a chemical is used in a cooling system it is subject to a set of physico-chemical conditions\nwhich will determine its fate. As examples can be mentioned:\nbreakdown in the cooling system due to hydrolysis or photolysis,\nadsorption by the system,\npartitioning between water and air,\nending up in the sludge,\nbiodegradation in the cooling system itself, in the waste treatment plants (chemical/biological),\nand in the river.\nThe portion that is not “lost” will end up in the river and will be diluted by the river flow. A\nprecise appraisal of the final River PEC, is only possible at local level.\nModels and algorithms to achieve this task are available, but they must take into account the\nvery specific conditions of each site. Obviously, also, the final PEC will depend on the amount\nof chemical that is fed, and this in turn depends on the size of the system and on the operating\nconditions (Number of cycles of concentration, size of the plant and amount of heat to be\nremoved).\nMost of the following analysis will center on describing a simple method to calculate a\n“standard” PEC (PEC standardised) which, while not bearing any resemblance with real PEC values,\npermits a rapid, preliminary evaluation of chemicals relative to one another. It is stressed that\nPEC standardised has only a very restricted, limited value, and can only be used as a general starting\npoint for the evaluation of the potential effects of chemicals relative to one another.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nVIII.1.3 \nBasic cooling towers material balances\nA very simple sketch of a Cooling Tower System is reported in Figure VIII.1 below.\nMU (CM)\nBD(CB)\nE+D\nW\nRIVER\nWR (C R)\nPHYSICAL/CHEMICAL\nBIOLOGICAL\nBD(CB)\nFigure VIII.1: Cooling tower material balance\nVIII.1.3.1 \nCooling towers basic equations\nMU \n: Make-Up Rate \nmc/hr\nBD \n: Blow-Down Rate \nmc/hr\nW \n: “Windage” (includes drift losses – “D”) \nmc/hr\nE \n: Evaporation Rate \nmc/hr\nCM \n: Concentration of Substance in MU mg/l - gr/mc\nCB \n: Concentration of Substance in BD mg/l - gr/mc\nNC \n: Cycles of Concentration = CB/CM\nVIII.1.3.2 \nWater balance\nMU = BD + E + W\nVIII.1.3.3 \nMaterial balance\nMU x CM = (BD + W) x CB\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nVIII.1.3.4 \nConcentration\nNc = CB/CM = MU/BD+ W\nVIII.1.3.5 \nDiscussion\nWater enters the cooling system through the make-up line. Water must be “made-up” to\ncompensate for the losses due to evaporation, “windage” and through the blow-down. The\n“windage” represents the quantity of water, which in the form of droplets escapes the cooling\ntower. It is assumed that the droplets carry with them the entrained chemicals at the same\nconcentration as in the blow-down.\nAs water recirculates through the plant’s equipment, it takes heat with it, which in turn is taken\nout in the cooling tower through evaporation. No chemicals are carried-over with the water\nvapour (evaporated water).\nThe Evaporation Rate “ E”, results from design requirements. To compensate for the\nevaporation, windage (and blow-down losses - see below) it is necessary to continue to feed an\nequivalent amount of make-up water.\nMake-up water, be it well water, or surface water, carries with it dissolved and suspended\nsolids, and the concentration and type of which will vary from case to case. A portion of the\nrecirculating water must, hence, be “blown-down” (discharged) to avoid the concentration of\ninput substances to increase above tolerable values due to evaporation.\nThe value of the blow-down rate must be fixed in order to maintain an optimum concentration\nof substances in the recirculating water, which will avoid, together with the appropriate\nchemical treatment, fouling (through precipitation and deposition of solids) and corrosion.\nThe blow-down rate is fixed when designing the chemical treatment and operating conditions.\nFrequently in practice, and in older systems, the blow-down cannot be controlled. It results, at\nleast partially, from unplanned water losses from various parts of the equipment being cooled.\nThe Number of Cycles of Concentration is the ratio between the concentration of substances in\nthe blow-down and that in the make up water. For instance if the concentration of the Calcium\nion in the make up is 200 ppm, with a Number of Cycles of 2, the concentration of Calcium in\nthe recirculating water will be equal to 400 ppm.\nThe material balance above, shows that the Number of Cycles of Concentration is equal to the\nratio MU/(BD +W), and when ignoring the windage, to the ratio MU/BD.\nChemicals are fed to the cooling system either (rarely) in the make-up line, or into the cooling\ntower basin. A certain concentration of chemicals must be “maintained” in the recirculating\nwater, which is equivalent to saying, maintained in the blow-down water. The higher the\nNumber of Cycles the lower the blow-down, the more severe the conditions of the system, but\nthe lower the quantity of chemicals continually lost.\nThis latest statement is true with the exception that when make-up substances are allowed to\nconcentrate more and more in the tower, more and different chemicals may be necessary to\nmaintain appropriate deposition-corrosion balance in the system.\nIn principle, though, in order to save water and chemicals (consumption, costs, and impact on\nthe environment) a fine balance must be sought at the highest possible Number of Cycles of\nConcentration.\nA certain concentration of treatment chemicals must be “maintained” in the recirculating water,\nand, hence, in the blow-down in order for the chemicals to perform their function.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nNormally, in complex multi-substance treatments, it is prescribed that the level of one easily\nmeasurable substance, is controlled and maintained at the values advised by the chemicals\nsuppliers. This corresponds to the implicit assumption that the ratio among the different\nchemicals stays the same, regardless of different rates of “losses” of the individual chemicals in\nthe system.\nIt also corresponds to the important assumption that, if the concentration of chemicals is\nmeasured (one chemical measured, the others calculated) in the blow-down, this value\ncorresponds to what is available in the cooling system, and that any other losses in the latter\nhave already been taken into account.\nIn other words, to evaluate the impact of the chemical(s) on the aquatic-environment, only the\nfate, or the variations in the concentration of the chemical downstream of the blow-down line\npoint, needs to be predicted (i.e. previously mentioned as “system” losses and the reductions in\nconcentration, due to processes such as hydrolysis, adsorption etc -are already taken into\naccount).\nThis assumption will be used in the Benchmarking Assessment Concept.\nVIII.1.4 \nCalculation of PEC and benchmarking\nTable VIII.1 below summarises the simple approach suggested for Benchmarking of single\nsubstances.\nThe suggested approach starts with the concept of calculating the “real” PECriver, and to divide it\nby the correspondent EQS, as derived from the WFD.\nTable VIII.1 below, shows how the “real” PEC can be calculated, and how, through successive\napproximations, it is possible to normalise/standardise the PEC estimation, and so render the\ncalculation applicable for “benchmarking” purposes. If the BD rate, the River flow, and the\nlosses of chemicals are known, the Concentration of the substance in the river results from the\nvery simple equation (1) reported in the table.\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable VIII.1: Calculation of PEC and Benchmarking\nPECriver/EQS (EQS from Water Framework)\nCB = Concentration in Blow-Down gr/mc\nCR = Concentration in River gr/mc = PECriver\nBD = Blow-Down Rate in mc/hr\nWR = River Flow in mc/hr\nt = (1 - % losses in Tower)\nw = (1 - % losses in Waste Water Treatment Plant - WTP)\nR = (1 - % losses in River)\n(1)\nCR = BD x CB x (t) x (w) x ( r) Local Assessment/Predict\n WR\nt = 1\nw = 1 \nr=1\nBD = 1\nIf also WR = 1 we have CB = CR = proportional to PEC river\nEquation (1), with all its elements known or calculated, can be used as such only for local level\nassessments.\nTo evaluate the losses in the cooling system, in the waste treatment plant, and in the river itself,\na lot of specific data needs to be available regarding chemical and physicochemical data of each\nsubstance. This ranges from volatility, to biodegradability and deposition rate and concerns the\nspecific conditions of the system, such as residence time of chemicals in the tower (proportional\nto the ratio Volume of System/Blow-Down rate), type and performance of waste treatment\nplants (chemical and biological), residence time in the river after initial mixing, and others.\nIn a “ desk- top “ benchmarking approach these data are not available. Hence the need for\nsimplification and approximation.\n-\nFirst of all it is assumed (see Table VIII.1) that the losses in the cooling system are\ntaken already into account by referring to the concentration of the chemical in the blow\ndown.\nSecondly it is assumed that no losses take place in the waste treatment plant.\n-\nThis second assumption is clearly not correct in the “real world” - it puts all chemicals\non the same level, whether or not they may be lost through precipitation in a chemical\ntreatment plant, or through partial or complete bio-degradation in a biological treatment\nplant. Consideration may be given to introducing a correction factor for chemicals with\ndifferent degrees of biodegradability; but it would also introduce a differentiation\nbetween different treatment situations, which will vary from case to case and site to site.\n-\nThirdly, it is assumed that no losses occur in the river, and this is normally done in risk\nassessment evaluations.\nThe key to the proposed Benchmarking approach lies in the next assumptions, that is that the\nBlow-Down Rate is equal to 1, and so is the river flow.\nThis means the PEC value has been normalised (i.e. PECstandardised), to allow the comparison\namong chemicals, independent of Blow-Down rate (size of plant and operating conditions), and\nof River Flow.\nIt is obvious that for the same chemical the PEC will be higher in a larger plant with a higher\nblow-down rate, and when the plant discharges into a small river.\nBut this in unimportant when a set of chemicals needs to be compared (i.e. “benchmarked”).\nWhat will count for Benchmarking purposes is the feed rate of the chemical, or in other words,\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nthe concentration which is recommended to be “maintained” in the recirculating system, and\nhence in the blow down. Normally chemical suppliers recommend a range of concentrations,\nvarying from case to case: the average recommended feed rate should be used.\nVIII.1.5 \nComputation methods\nVIII.1.5.1 \nSingle Substances\nOne-substance chemical treatments very rarely apply. In most cases various combinations of\nchemicals, inorganic and organic are used in cooling systems.\nExamples of single substances are mostly related to the use of single biocides in the system, or\nsingle polymers in Waste Treatment Plants. Still, there is quite likely to remain a desire,\npossibly at Member State level rather than at local level, to Benchmark the most typical\nindividual substances that are on the Market.\nAt local level it is easier to imagine that the necessity will arise to compare complete treatments,\none against the other, rather than individual substances. A balanced vision of the overall impact\nof the various substances on the aquatic-environment can only be acquired at local level, when\ndifferent proposed treatments have to be compared.\nAt any rate, the Benchmarking Procedure proposed here, does imply very simple computations\nfor individual substances. The average prescribed concentration of the substance in the blow\ndown is one of the terms that need to be known. It is generally expressed in parts per million\n(ppm) or milligrams per litre (mg/l) in the blow-down, and above we refer to this number as\nPECstandardised.\nThe other element of the Equation is the PNEC or EQS. This may either have been already fixed\nby the Member State, or it will have to be “agreed” at local level using the WFD Annex V\nprocedure, based on data furnished by the supplier of chemicals. EQSs are also normally\nexpressed in ppm, and sometimes in ppb or micrograms per liter.\nThe PEC/PNEC ratio can hence be easily calculated for all the substances, which need to be\nassessed. The resulting value is a purely numerical ratio (if both PNEC and EQS are expressed\nin the same units, ppm, or ppb). The lower the ratio, the less the potential impact of the\nsubstance.\nIt is stressed once more that this Benchmarking Assessment Concept represents a standardised\nmethodology for assessing potential impacts of cooling water chemicals, which strips out all\nlocal-specific characteristics, and all physico-chemical characteristics of substances except for\ntoxicity. As such, it can perform a useful function in helping identify areas that require\nadditional investigation, and in designing chemical treatments into the overall operating-design\nprocedures of the plant. However, it is not suitable nor intended for use as a decision tool for\nlocal level assessments: the fact that one substance may have a lower PECstandardised : EQS ratio\ndoes not imply that this is necessarily the best choice for a particular situation once other local,\nplant and substance-specific factors are taken into account.\nVIII.1.5.2 \nComplex multi-substances treatments\nThis will in practice most often be the case faced by local authorities and plant operators in\npermit applications.\nBefore carrying out, with the assistance of the supplier, a complete substance by substance real\nlife PEC evaluation, which may be necessary in certain cases, the simplified benchmarking\napproach may be used to help design chemical treatments into the overall operating-design\nprocedures of the plant.\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nConsideration may be given to using an additive procedure whereby the PEC/PNEC ratios for\neach individual substance is calculated with the method explained above, and they are then\nadded together to yield a relative “index” number. This approach is similar to that used for the\nclassification of chemical preparations based on the classification of the individual substances of\nwhich they are composed. The lower the value of the resulting sum the less is the foreseeable\nenvironmental impact of the complex treatment.\nNeedless to say, a sum of all the values of individual ratios, leading to a figure of less than 1\nwould be preferable to a result above 1.This would have meaning only when the real local\ndilution factor is known and inserted in the evaluation.\nHowever, when values above 1 are found, and it is felt that, from a technical stand point the\nspecific treatment presents other environmental/economic advantages (less water, less energy) it\nwill be necessary to go into a more sophisticated risk assessment procedure. This may imply\nboth a precise calculation of all the losses of the chemical in the system (fate) and a refinement\nof the evaluation of the PNEC (Chronic Data instead of Acute).\nIt would not seem that actually carrying out centrally in the BREF, or even at Member State\nlevel, a general benchmarking exercise including all possible treatments and combinations is a\nrealistic idea. Multi-substance Benchmarking (i.e. of treatments) is more appropriately to be\nconsidered a local affair and reference is made to Section VII.2 of this Annex.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nVIII.1.6 \nAppendix I: extract from technical guidance document\nChapter 3 (Environmental Risk Assessment), section 3.3.1 of Part II of “Technical\nguidance document in support of Commission Directive 93/67/EEC on risk assessment for\nnew notified substances and Commission Regulation (EC) no 1488/94 on risk assessment\nfor existing substances”.\n3.3\nEffects assessment for the aquatic compartment\n3.3.1\nCalculation of PNEC\nThe function of risk assessment is the overall protection of the environment. Certain\nassumptions are made concerning the aquatic-environment, which allow, however uncertain, an\nextrapolation to be made from single-species short-term toxicity data to ecosystem effects. It is\nassumed that:\n• \necosystem sensitivity depends on the most sensitive species; and\n• \nprotecting of ecosystem structure protects community function.\nThese two assumptions have important consequences. By establishing which species is the most\nsensitive to the toxic effects of a chemical in the laboratory, extrapolation can subsequently be\nbased on the data from that species. Furthermore, the functioning of any ecosystem in which\nthat species exists is protected provided the structure is not sufficiently distorted as to cause an\nimbalance. It is generally accepted that protection of the most sensitive species should protect\nstructure, and hence function.\nFor all new substances the pool of data from which to predict ecosystem effects is very limited:\nonly short-term data are available at the base-set. For most existing substances the situation is\nthe same: in many cases, only short-term toxicity data are available. In these circumstances, it is\nrecognised that, while not having a strong scientific validity, empirically derived assessment\nfactors must be used. Assessment factors have also been proposed by the EPA and OECD\n(OECD, 1992d). In applying such factors, the intention is to predict a concentration below\nwhich an unacceptable effect will most likely not occur. It is not intended to be a level below\nwhich the chemical is considered to be safe. However, again, it is likely that an unacceptable\neffect will occur.\nIn establishing the size of these assessment factors, a number of uncertainties must be addressed\nto be able to extrapolate from single-species laboratory data to a multi-species ecosystem. These\nareas have been adequately discussed in other papers, and may best be summarised under the\nfollowing headings:\n• \nIntra- and inter-laboratory variation of toxicity data\n• \nIntra- and inter-species variations (biological variance)\n• \nShort-term to long-term toxicity extrapolation\n• \nLaboratory data to field impact extrapolation\n (Extrapolation is required from mono-species tests to ecosystem. Additive,\n synergistic and antagonistic effects arising from the presence of other substances\n may also play a role).\nThe size of the assessment factor depends on the confidence with which a PNECwater can be\nderived from the available data. This confidence increases, if data are available on the toxicity\nto organisms at a number of trophic levels, taxonomic groups and with lifestyles representing\nvarious feeding strategies. Thus, lower assessment factors can be used with larger and more\nrelevant data sets than the base-set data. The proposed assessment factors are presented in Table\nVII.1.\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFor new substances and assessment factor of 1000 will be applied on the lowest L(E)C50 of the\nbase-set. Also for existing substances the assessment factor is generally applied to the lowest of\nthe relevant available toxicity data, irrespective of whether the species tested is a standard\norganism (see notes to Table 14). For short-term tests, the L(E)C50 is used, while the NOEC is\nused with long-term tests. For some compounds, a large number of validated short-term L(E)C50\nvalues may be available. Therefore, it is proposed to calculate the arithmetic mean if more than\none L(E)C50 value is available for the same species. Prior to calculating the arithmetic mean an\nanalysis of test conditions has to be done in order to find out why differences in response were\nfound.\nThe algal growth inhibition test of the base-set is, in principle, a multi-generation test. However,\nfor the purposes of applying the appropriate assessment factors, the EC50 is treated as a short-\nterm toxicity value. The NOEC from this test may be used as an additional NOEC when other\nlong-term data are available. In general, an algal NOEC should not be used unsupported by\nlong-term NOECs of species of other trophic levels. However, if a chemical shows a specific\ntoxicity to algae, the algal NOEC determined from the base-set test should be supported by a\nsecond algae species test.\nMicroorganisms representing a further trophic level may only be used if non-adapted pure\ncultures were tested. The investigations with bacteria (e.g., growth tests) are regarded as short-\nterm tests. Additionally, blue-green algae should be counted among the primary producers to\ntheir autotrophic nutrition.\nTable VIII.2: Assessment factors to derive a PNEC\nDescription\nAssessment factor\nAt least one short-term L(E)C50 from each of three trophic levels of\nthe base-set (fish, Daphnia and algae)\n1000 (a)\nOne long-term NOEC (either fish or Daphnia)\n100 (b)\nTwo long-term NOECs from species representing two trophic levels\n(fish and/or Daphnia and/or algae)\n50 (c)\nLong-term NOECs from at least three species (normally fish,\nDaphnia and algae) representing three trophic levels\n10 (d)\nField data or model ecosystems\nReviewed on a case by case\nbasis (e)\nNOTES :\n(a)\nThe use of a factor of 1000 on short-term toxicity data is a conservative and protective\nfactor and is designed to ensure that substances with the potential to cause adverse\neffects are identified in the effects assessment. It assumes that each of the above-\nidentified uncertainties makes a significant contribution to the overall uncertainty.\nFor any given substance there may be evidence that this is not so, or that one particular\ncomponent of the uncertainty is more important than any other. In these circumstances\nit may be necessary to vary this factor. This variation may lead to a raised or lowered\nassessment factor depending on the evidence available. Except for substances with\nintermittent release (see Section 3.3.2) under no circumstances should a factor lower\nthan 100 be used in deriving a PNECwater from short-term toxicity data. Evidence for\nvarying the assessment factor could include one or more of the following aspects:\n•\nevidence from structurally similar compounds (Evidence from a closely related\ncompound may demonstrate that a higher or lower factor may be appropriate).\n•\nknowledge of the mode of action. (Some substances, by virtue of their structure,\nmay be known to act in a non-specific manner. A lower factor may therefore be\nconsidered. Equally a known specific mode of action may lead to a raised\nfactor).\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n•\nthe availability of data from a wide selection of species covering additional\ntaxonomic groups other than those represented by the base-set species.\n•\nthe availability of data from a variety of species covering the taxonomic groups\nof base-set species across at least three trophic levels.\nIn such a case the assessment factors may only be lowered if these multiple data\npoints are available for the most sensitive taxonomic group.\nThere are cases where the base-set is not complete: e.g., for substances, which are\nproduced at < 1 t/a (notifications according to Annex VII B of Directive 92/32/EEC). At\nthe most the acute toxicity for Daphnia is determined. In these exceptional cases, the\nPNEC should be calculated with a factor of 1000. Variation from a factor of 1000\nshould not be regarded as normal and should be fully supported by accompanying\nevidence.\n(b)\nAn assessment factor of 100 applies to a single long-term NOEC (fish or Daphnia) if\nthis NOEC was generated for the trophic level showing the lowest L(E)C50 in the short-\nterm tests. If the only available long-term NOEC is from a species (standard or non-\nstandard organism) which does not have the lowest L(E)C50 from the short-term tests, it\ncannot be regarded as protective of other more sensitive species using the assessment\nfactors available. Thus, the effects assessment is based on the short-term data with an\nassessment factor of 1000. However, the resulting PNEC based on short-term data may\nnot be higher than the PNEC based on the long-term NOEC available.\nAn assessment factor of 100 applies also to the lowest of two long-term NOECs\ncovering two trophic levels when such NOECs have not been generated from that\nshowing the lowest L(E)C50 of the short-term tests.\n(c) \nAn assessment factor of 50 applies to the lowest of two NOECs covering two trophic\nlevels when such NOECs have been generated covering that level showing the lowest\nL(E)C50 in the short-term tests. It also applies to the lowest of three NOECs covering\nthree trophic levels when such NOECs have not been generated from that level showing\nthe lowest L(E)C50 in the short-term tests.\n(d) \nAn assessment factor of 10 will normally only be applied when long-term toxicity\nNOECs are available from at least three species across three trophic levels (e.g., fish,\nDaphnia, and algae or a non-standard organism instead of a standard organism).\nWhen examining the results of long-term toxicity studies, the PNECwater should be\ncalculated from the lowest available no observed effect concentration (NOEC).\nExtrapolation to the ecosystem effects can be made with much greater confidence, and\nthus a reduction of the assessment factor to 10 is possible. This is only sufficient,\nhowever, if the species tested can be considered to represent one of the more sensitive\ngroups. This would normally only be possible to determine if data were available on at\nleast three species across three trophic levels. It may sometimes be possible to\ndetermine with high probability that the most sensitive species has been examined, i.e.,\nthat a further long-term NOEC from a different taxonomic group would not be lower\nthan the data already available. In those circumstances a factor of 10 applied to the\nlowest NOEC from only two species would also be appropriate. This is particularly\nimportant if the substance does not have a potential to bioaccumulate. If it is not\npossible to make this judgment, then an assessment factor of 50 should be applied to\ntake into account any interspecies variation in sensitivity. A factor of 10 cannot be\ndecreased on the basis of laboratory studies.\n(e)\nThe assessment factor to be used on mesocosm studies or (semi-)field data will need to\nbe reviewed on a case by case basis.\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nFor compounds with a high log Kow no short-term toxicity may be found. Also, even in\nlong-term tests this may be the case or steady state may still not have been reached. For\ntests with fish for non-polar narcotics the latter can be substantiated by the use of long-\nterm QSARs (see Section 3.2.1.2 and Chapter 4 on the Use of QSARs). It can be\nconsidered to use a higher assessment factor in such cases where steady state seems not\nto have been reached.\nFor substances for which no toxicity is observed in short-term tests a long-term test has\nto be carried out if the log Kow > 3 (or BCF > 100) and if the PEClocal/regional is > 1/100th\nof the water solubility (see Section 4.5). The long-term toxicity test should normally be\na Daphnia test to avoid unnecessary vertebrate testing. The NOEC from this test can\nthen be used with an assessment factor of 100. If in addition to the required long-term\ntest a NOEC is determined from an algae test of the base-set an assessment factor of 50\nis applied.\nThe effects assessment performed with assessment factors can be supported by a\nstatistical extrapolation method if the data basis is sufficient for its application (see\nAppendix V).\nVIII.2 Concept of a local assessment method for cooling water\ntreatment chemicals, with a particular emphasis on\nbiocides\nVIII.2.1 \nIntroduction\nOne of the major environmental issues identified in the industrial cooling systems BREF\nconcerning wet cooling systems is the chemical treatment of cooling water (anti-corrosion; anti-\nscaling, anti-fouling, biofouling control), and the resulting emissions to surface water.\nParticular emphasis is placed on biocides, due to their inherent high toxicity, which is necessary\nas a result of the particular function they must perform.\nThe cooling BREF identifies three levels at which techniques may be employed to reduce the\nimpact of cooling water additives/ biocides on receiving water bodies:\n1. Preventive measures (Table 4.7)\n2. Optimisation of operation, including monitoring (Table 4.8)\n3. Selection & application of additives (Table 4.8)\nThe three levels of control interact with each other, and discussions in the TWG have\nestablished that the selection of appropriate additives is a complex exercise, which must take\ninto account a number of local and site-specific factors.\nThe need to provide an outline of the concepts underlying assessment of cooling water\nadditives/biocides has been identified as an important BAT measure to help reduce the\nenvironmental impact of additives, and biocides in particular. In this connection, the BREF\ncontains an Annex which establishes a screening assessment tool based on existing\nmethodologies and data (“Benchmarking Assessment”); and Chapter 3 also provides some\nbackground information on the assessment regimes used in the Netherlands and Germany.\nIn a horizontal BREF it is only possible and appropriate to conclude in general terms on the\nconcepts which will facilitate the application of BAT principles regarding selection of biocides\nand other additives. Specific installation characteristics, climatic conditions and the local\nenvironment are key elements in the determination of a BAT compatible approach at the local\nlevel for individual installations.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nThe justification for the emphasis on biocides in any assessment regime is that their intrinsic\nproperties result in them being considered to be of higher potential concern in terms of impacts\non receiving water bodies. At the point of exit, discharges from cooling systems using biocides\nmay exhibit acute toxicity. Local circumstances, the characteristics of the substances employed,\nand in particular the actual dilution in the receiving water, determine whether Environmental\nQuality Standards (EQSs) can be met. Proper selection and reduction of potential impacts\nresulting from biocide use can only be adequately addressed when potential impacts can be\nassessed. The yardstick by which a BAT-compatible approach to the application of additives/\nbiocides can be judged is the environmental status of the receiving water body.\nFor the above reasons, the horizontal cooling BREF should provide guidance on how to address\nsite-specific issues in the local level assessment of biocides used in cooling systems. Such a\nlocal assessment can be seen as a subsequent, and more detailed step following an (optional)\npreliminary screening exercise such as the Benchmark Method presented in the Annex VI.1.\nTherefore, the BREF aims to provide guidance on the concepts relevant to assessment of local\ncircumstances, without prescribing the methodology itself. Numerous and constantly evolving\nmethodologies and models are available for assessing local level emissions scenarios (ranging\nfrom simple to highly sophisticated). It should be up to permit applicants and Member State\nauthorities to select and use methodologies, which are appropriate to the local conditions and\nthe level of concern about potential environmental effects.\nVIII.2.2 \nKey elements\nIn the context of how to address minimisation of the impact specifically of biocide use in\ncooling systems according to the principles of BAT, there are two key building blocks that it is\nimportant to be aware of:\n• \nThe Biocidal Products Directive 98/8/EC (BPD), which since 14/5/2000 has regulated the\nplacing on the European market of biocidal products. In this context, the EU will examine\nexposure scenarios in order to evaluate the risks associated with all the 23 product-\ncategories which are covered. One of the product-types considered for authorisation covers\nbiocides used in cooling systems (product-type 11). New biocides are to be assessed and\napproved immediately according to the Directive. An extension has been made for existing\nsubstances, which will be reviewed in due course.\n• \nThe future Water Framework Directive (WFD), which provides a whole host of quality\nrelated objectives. These specifically include a methodology to be used to establish\nEnvironmental Quality Standards (EQSs) for chemical substances, which is laid down in\nAnnex V of the WFD text. The methodology for setting EQSs is identical to that used to\ndetermine conservative Predicted No Effect Concentrations (PNECs) according to the\ntesting methods laid down in EU chemicals legislation. The method incorporates a “safety\nfactor” of up to 1000 in order to take account of the uncertainties involved in extrapolating\nfrom toxicity testing on selected organisms to the protection of the aquatic ecosystem.\nToxicity data for biocides used in cooling systems is either already generally available, or will\nbe made available together with data on other relevant intrinsic properties (e.g. biodegradability,\nbioaccumulation) according to the registration procedures laid down under the BPD. Based on\nthis data the methodology laid down in Annex V of the WFD can be used to determine the EQS\n(i.e. the PNEC value) for a substance in water.\nThe EQS can then be compared to the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) to help\ndetermine what potential there may be for impact to occur. Since the EQS corresponds to the\nPNEC, this is frequently referred to as a “PEC : PNEC comparison”. As noted above, numerous\nmethods are available to calculate the concentration of substances expected to be found in\nreceiving waters as a result of a discharge (i.e. PEC).\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nThe PEC/PNEC value can be used as a yardstick for the BAT determination for a BAT\ncompatible approach for biocides used in cooling systems. It should however be recognised that\na certain distinction in this approach has to be made between new and existing installations. A\nPEC : PNEC value of <1 in the receiving water after realistic mixing & dilution could provide\nthe yardstick (as a limit value) for biocide use in new cooling systems. For existing cooling\nsystems where many design parameters & other installation characteristics are already\nestablished it will not always be possible to achieve PEC : PNEC <1 at a cost which is\neconomically viable as described in the definition of BAT. In these cases the PEC : PNEC <1\nshould remain the target (as a benchmark), but may have to be considered a longer term goal\nwhich fits with equipment replacement cycles etc.\nFigure VIII.2 shows a graphical presentation giving an example of how a BAT-compatible\napproach might be determined for the use of biocides in existing cooling systems. Properly\noptimised operation in a well designed cooling system can be considered BAT when a PEC :\nPNEC value <1 is achieved. For installations that cannot achieve PEC : PNEC <1 due to sub-\noptimal design or other local/ site-specific factors, it will be necessary to optimise the operation\nof the system as far as is feasible.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\nSELECTION OF BIOCIDES\n- biocides directive 1); \n- technical characteristics of\n \nInstallation;\n- environmental impact\nAdvanced measures : \nPilot research for the application (new)\nalternatives in the specific situation\nOPTIMIZATION\nGood operating practice 2)\n(fig. 3.3 of BREF document)\n)\nAdvanced measures 3) 4)\nLOCAL ASSESSMENT : \nAre local EQS met ?\n \nBAT\nPEC/PNEC <1\nSTART",

The further elaboration in step\n2 and 3 might result in a different order of preference of possible biocides.\n2) \nThe OPTIMISATION STEP :\nThe optimisation step includes all kinds of process-, dosage- and monitoring techniques as well\nas purification of make up water, side-stream filtration and process control measures such a\ntemporally closure of the bleed of a recirculation system.\n3) \nThe LOCAL ASSESSMENT :\nThe local assessment is the final step in the assessment of biocides and provides plant operators,\nchemical suppliers and regulators a yard stick which enables them to determine to what extent\noperations, control techniques and measures have to be applied in order to meet local EQSs.\nAs example the following situation has been elaborated: a recirculating cooling system has to be\ntreated with chemicals to prevent microbiological fouling of the cooling system. The\ndimensions of the cooling system are presented in Figure VIII.3.\n\nAnnex VIII\n\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nV-cooling system = 4500 [m3]\nConcentration factor (n) = 3\ndischarge = 203 [m3/hr]\nIntake = 609 [m3/hr]\nSurface water\nflow [m3/sec]\nOptimisation measures\n(monitoring and dosage)\nPretreatment measures\nRecirculating flow = 18000 [m3/hr]\nEnd of pipe measures\nbiotreater\nPEC :\nPredicted concentration of biocide in\nsurface water\nFigure VIII.3: Schematic representation of a recirculating cooling system with the data for the\nexample of a local selection method of cooling systems chemicals\nFor this example the assumption is made, that the result of step 1 (Benchmark method) resulted\nin the selection of the biocides hypochlorite in combination with dibromonitrilopropionamide\n(DBNPA).\nThe optimisation in terms adequate monitoring and dosage of the hypochlorite shows that the\naverage concentration in the effluent should not exceed a concentration of 0.2 [mg FO/l].\nFor the non-oxidising biocide DBPNA the optimisation results in a shock dosage at a\nconcentration of 4 [mg/l] (frequency: once a day).\nDPBNA is an additive which readily hydrolyses in water (τ1/2 = 2 hr). This property of the\nadditive can be a benefit in reducing the emissions from the cooling system and the realisation\nof a more effective use of the biocide. By closing the discharge during and after dosage for a\ncertain period the concentration of the biocide will be reduced in the system. In this particular\ncase, where DPBNA is been considered, the temporally closure of the bleed provides an\nadditional (optimisation) option to reduce the amount of biocides discharged into the\nenvironment. From the operators point of view the question is: to what extent will it be possible\nto close the bleed of the recirculating system, in order to reduce the concentration of DBPNA\nthrough hydrolysis to a sufficient level, without hampering a good operational performance of\nthe cooling system? This sufficient level is a concentration of DPBNA in the effluent leading to\na concentration in the recipient (PEC: predicted environmental concentration) which will not\nexceed the EQS.\nIn the next table the predicted concentration of DBNPA in several types of surface water is\ncalculated and in the last column the reduction percentage required to meet the EQS for these\nsurface waters has been determined.\n\nAnnex VIII\nIndustrial Cooling Systems\n\nTable VIII.3: Predicted concentrations of DBNPA in different surface waters for this example\nSituation:\nRecirculating cooling system ; discharge volume (bleed) : 203 [m3/hr]; biocide used : DBPNA ;\nDosage : shock (daily) : concentration : 4 [mg/l] ; EQS : 7 [µg/l].\nDimensions\nReceiving water\nFlow\n[m3/sec]\nWidth\n[m]\nDepth\n[m]\nVelocity\n[m/sec]\nDilution\nafter\ndischarge\nPEC\n[ug/l]\nNecessary\nreduction [%]\nto meet EQS\nAverage river\n\n\n2,6\n0,192\n\n36,4\n80,5\nLarge river\n\n\n3,8\n0,552\n\n5,2\n\nSmall river/brook\n\n\n1,5\n0,067\n\n\n98,5\nLarge canal\n\n\n\n0,033\n\n43,5\n83,9\nSmall canal\n\n\n\n0,04\n\n\n97,6\nDitch\n0,15\n\n\n0,03\n\n\n99,5\nLake\n-\n-\n1,5\n0,01\n\n\n99,5\nThe Table VIII.3 shows that a direct discharge leads to an exceeding of the EQS for most of the\nselected surface waters. Only a discharge of the effluent in a large river leads to an acceptable\nconcentration of DBPNA in surface water.\nFor this example the PEC is calculated using a model which is generally excepted in the\nNetherlands and is used by permitting authorities for a local impact assessment after BAT in a\nmore general sense has been determined (combined approach). The Dutch model is based on the\nFisher equations. The PEC is calculated at a distance of 10 times the width of the receiving\nwater system with a maximum of 1000 m (for lakes at a distance of ¼ of the diameter).\nIt is expected that most member states will have their own methodologies or will use dilution\nfactors for different type of recipients to determine the PEC.\nThe Environmental Quality Standard for DBPNA is calculated according the methodology that\nhas been laid down in Annex V of the Water Framework Directive. The data listed in the table\nbelow result in a n EQS for DBNPA of 7 [ug/l]. (one NOEC and 3 acute data result in a safety\nfactor of 100; lowest concentration /100 \u0001 7 [ug/l] [1]).\nTable VIII.4: Ecological data of DBNPA\nParameter\nConcentration\nLC-50 (fish) 96-hr\n2 [mg/l]\nMIC (algea)\n2 [mg/l]\nLC-50 (crustacean)",
