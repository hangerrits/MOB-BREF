# EU BAT-RIE Compliance Verification System

## Overview

This system provides automated compliance verification for EU environmental permits against the Industrial Emissions Directive (RIE) and Best Available Techniques Reference Documents (BREFs). It uses AI-powered analysis to determine regulatory applicability and assess compliance with BAT conclusions.

## System Components

### 1. Regulatory Data Management (`regulatory_data_manager.py`)
- **RIE Activities Database**: Stores activities from RIE Annex I with categories and threshold values
- **BREF Documents Catalog**: Manages BREF documents with sector classifications
- **BAT Conclusions Database**: Stores extracted BAT conclusions from BREF documents
- **SQLite Database**: Persistent storage for all regulatory data

### 2. Compliance Engine (`compliance_engine.py` / `compliance_engine_standalone.py`)
- **Document Classification**: Automatically categorizes permit documents (decision, application, advice, MER, etc.)
- **Activity Extraction**: Identifies activities, sectors, and capacity information from permits
- **RIE Applicability Assessment**: Matches permit activities against RIE categories
- **BREF Applicability Analysis**: Determines which BREFs apply to specific activities
- **BAT Compliance Verification**: Checks permit conditions against applicable BAT conclusions
- **Procedural Compliance**: Verifies MER requirements and consultation procedures

### 3. LLM Integration (`llm_handler.py`)
- **OpenAI API Integration**: Uses GPT models for sophisticated regulatory analysis
- **BREF Applicability Determination**: AI-powered matching of activities to BREF scopes
- **BAT Compliance Verification**: Detailed analysis of permit compliance with specific BAT conclusions
- **Structured JSON Responses**: Standardized output format for system integration

### 4. PDF Processing (`pdf_processor.py`)
- **Document Text Extraction**: Uses Docling for advanced PDF content extraction
- **Metadata Extraction**: Retrieves document titles, dates, and structure
- **Multi-format Support**: Handles various permit document formats

### 5. Report Generation (`report_generator.py`)
- **Markdown Reports**: Structured compliance reports in Markdown format
- **PDF Reports**: Professional PDF reports using WeasyPrint
- **Compliance Summaries**: Executive summaries with key findings and recommendations

## Key Features

### ✅ Regulatory Database
- RIE activities with threshold values and categories
- BREF document catalog with 10+ major industrial sectors
- BAT conclusions database (ready for document processing)
- Fast SQLite-based queries with indexing

### ✅ AI-Powered Analysis
- **BREF Applicability**: Accurately determines which BREFs apply to specific activities
  - Example: Dairy farm → FDM (Food, Drink and Milk Industries) = "Likely Applicable"
  - Example: Dairy farm → IRPP (Intensive Rearing of Poultry or Pigs) = "Not Applicable"

- **BAT Compliance Verification**: Detailed assessment of permit compliance
  - Example: Nutritional management BAT → "Partially Compliant" with specific gaps identified

### ✅ Document Processing
- Automatic document type classification based on filename and content
- Activity extraction with sector classification and capacity identification
- Multi-document permit file processing

### ✅ Compliance Assessment
- RIE threshold verification
- BREF applicability analysis
- BAT conclusion compliance checking
- Procedural requirement verification (MER, consultation rights)
- Overall compliance scoring with recommendations

## Usage Examples

### Basic System Demo
```bash
python3 demo_compliance_system.py
```

### Enhanced AI Analysis
```bash
python3 enhanced_compliance_engine.py
```

### Full Permit Analysis
```bash
python3 compliance_engine_standalone.py
```

## Test Results

The system successfully analyzed a livestock permit and correctly:

1. **Identified BREF Applicability**:
   - ✅ FDM (Food, Drink and Milk Industries): "Likely Applicable"
   - ✅ IRPP (Intensive Rearing of Poultry or Pigs): "Not Applicable"
   - ✅ LCP (Large Combustion Plants): "Not Applicable"
   - ✅ WT (Waste Treatment): "Potentially Applicable"

2. **Assessed BAT Compliance**:
   - ✅ Nutritional Management BAT: "Partially Compliant"
   - ✅ Identified specific gaps in permit conditions
   - ✅ Provided detailed compliance findings

## Database Statistics
- **RIE Activities**: 5 initial categories loaded
- **BREF Documents**: 10 major industrial sectors cataloged
- **BAT Conclusions**: Ready for extraction from BREF documents
- **Database**: SQLite with optimized indexes for fast queries

## Supported Industries
- Livestock/Agriculture (Intensive Rearing, Food Processing)
- Energy (Large Combustion Plants, Refineries)
- Chemical Industry (Organic/Inorganic Chemicals, Polymers)
- Manufacturing (Metals, Glass, Ceramics, Textiles)
- Waste Management (Treatment, Incineration)
- Food Processing (Food, Drink, Milk Industries)

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Complete RIE Database**: Add all activities from RIE Annex I
2. **Download BREF Documents**: Implement automated BREF document downloading and BAT extraction
3. **Enhanced Document Parsing**: Improve permit document structure recognition
4. **Legal Compliance Engine**: Add comprehensive procedural compliance checking
5. **Web Interface**: Develop user-friendly web interface for permit uploads
6. **Integration**: Connect with existing permit management systems

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- OpenAI API key (stored in `.env` file)
- Required packages: see `requirements.txt`
- SQLite database (automatically created)
- ~500MB disk space for regulatory data storage
