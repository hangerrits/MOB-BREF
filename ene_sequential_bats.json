Although these features have \nadvantages, systems without them can be BAT. These three additional steps are: \n\n(see Section 2.1(h)) preparation and publication (and possibly external validation) of a\nregular energy efficiency statement describing all the significant environmental aspects of\nthe installation, allowing for year-by-year comparison against environmental objectives\nand targets as well as with sector benchmarks as appropriate\n\n(see Section 2.1(i)) having the management system and audit procedure examined and\nvalidated by an accredited certification body or an external ENEMS verifier\n\n(see Section 2.1, Applicability, 2) implementation and adherence to a nationally or\ninternationally accepted voluntary system such as:\n◦\nDS2403, IS 393, SS627750, VDI Richtlinie No. 46, etc.\n◦\n(when including energy efficiency management in an EMS) EMAS and\nEN ISO 14001:1996. This voluntary step could give higher credibility to the\nENEMS. However, non-standardised systems can be equally effective provided\nthat they are properly designed and implemented.\nApplicability: All installations. The scope and nature (e.g. level of detail) of applying this \nENEMS will depend on the nature, scale and complexity of the installation, and the energy \nrequirements of the component processes and systems. \n4.2.2 \nPlanning and establishing objectives and targets \n4.2.2.1 \nContinuous environmental improvement \nAn important aspect of environmental management systems is continuing environmental \nimprovement. This requires maintaining a balance for an installation between consumption of \nenergy, raw materials and water, and the emissions (see Sections 1.1.6 and 2.2.1). Planned \ncontinuous improvement can also achieve the best cost-benefit for achieving energy savings \n(and other environmental benefits).",

The scope and nature (e.g. level of detail) of applying this \ntechnique will depend on the nature, scale and complexity of the installation, and the energy \nrequirements of the component processes and systems. \n\nChapter 4 \n\nEnergy Efficiency \n4.3 \nBest available techniques for achieving energy efficiency \nin energy-using systems, processes, activities or \nequipment \nIntroduction \nSection 4.2.2.3 identifies the importance of seeing the installation as a whole, and assessing the \nneeds and purposes of the various systems, their associated energies and their interactions. \nBAT 7 gives examples of systems commonly found in installations. \nIn Section 4.2, there are BAT that are generally applicable to all systems, processes and \nassociated activities. These include: \n\nanalysing and benchmarking the system and its performance (BAT 1, 3, 4, 8 and 9)\n\nplanning actions and investments to optimise energy efficiency considering the cost-\nbenefits and cross-media effects (BAT 2)\n\nfor new systems, optimising energy efficiency in the design of the installation, unit or\nsystem and in the selection of processes (BAT 10)\n\nfor existing systems, optimising the energy efficiency of the system through its operation\nand management, including regular monitoring and maintenance (see BAT 14, 15 and\n16).\nThe BAT presented in this section therefore assume that these general BAT in Section 4.2 are \nalso applied to the systems described below, as part of their optimisation. \n4.3.1 \nCombustion \nCombustion is a widely used process for both direct heating (such as in cement and lime \nmanufacture, steel making) and indirect heating (such as firing steam boiler systems and \nelectricity generation). Techniques for energy efficiency in combustion are therefore addressed \nin the appropriate sector BREFs. For other cases, such as combustion in associated activities, \nthe Scope of the LCP BREF states: \n'…smaller units can potentially be added to a plant to build one larger installation exceeding 50 \nMW. This means that all kinds of conventional power plants (e.g. utility boiler, combined heat \nand power plants, district heating plants.) used for mechanical power and heat generation are \ncovered by this (LCP BREF) work.'",

Air conditioning is \nincreasingly used across Europe, particularly in the south. \nVentilation is essential for many industrial installations to function. It: \n\nprotects staff from pollutant and heat emissions within premises\n\nmaintains a clean working atmosphere to protect product quality.\nRequirements may be dictated by health, safety and process considerations (see Section 3.9).",
