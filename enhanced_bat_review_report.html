Monitoring
BAT 5.
For waste water streams identified by the inventory of inputs and outputs (see BAT 2), BAT is to 
monitor key process parameters (e.g. continuous monitoring of waste water flow, pH and temperature) 
at key locations (e.g. at the inlet and/or outlet of the waste water pretreatment, at the inlet to the final 
waste water treatment, at the point where the emission leaves the installation).

            <div class="bat-text">rogrammes can be highly complex and the range of chemicals used can be large.  As
a consequence, emission levels in the blowdown of these systems also show large variation and
representative emission levels are difficult to report.  Sometimes the blowdown is treated before
discharge.
Emissions of oxidizing biocides in open once-through systems, measured as free oxidant at the
outlet, vary between 0.1 [mg FO/l] and 0.5 [mg FO/l] depending on the pattern and frequency of
dosage.

pump to transport the biofilter effluent back to the cooling tower header where the static
pressure is 14 mwg, can avoid this drawback. On average, 1¬Ω m3/hr per MWth cooling have to
be pumped, which is equivalent with a direct energy consumption of 0.1 kWe/MWth cooling or 0.25
kWth/MWth cooling (with 40% efficiency of power plant). This is also quite limited in comparison
with the standard (in) direct energy use for cooling tower processes.

Costs:
Research costs amounted to EUR 1 million during first 5 years. The first dosage installation was
EUR 0.2 million, and further modifications again EUR were 0.2 million. The pay back period of
the dosage installation was in the order of one year and based on the following costs:

            <div class="bat-text">plemental ionic water purification is an alternative
method to treat cooling tower water with copper ions. It is claimed that a chemical-only water
treatment system can be replaced by this technique leading to less harmful substances being
more economical to the environment.
Reduction:
Microbiologists are quoted that have determined that small amounts of copper acting as
supplement to chlorine at 0.4 ppm have the same efficiency as 2.0 ppm free chlorine.
Cross-media effect:
Costs have not been reported, but could be energy input for copper ion generator.
Application limits:
To apply this treatment a copper ion generator is needed together with a device to control total
dissolved solids, a magnetic water conditioning system and a system to analyse the water
composition. With these systems the treatment can be optimised.

Depending on species and water temperature (above 10-12¬∞C) continuous treatment at low
levels may be necessary.
For seawater, BAT-levels of free residual oxidant (FRO) in the discharge, associated with these
practices, vary with applied dosage regime (continuous and discontinuous) and dosage
concentration level and with the cooling system configuration. They range from ‚â§ 0.1 [mg/l] to
0.5 [mg/l], with a value of 0.2 [mg/l] as 24h-average.
An important element in introducing a BAT-based approach to water treatment, in particular for
recirculating systems using non-oxidizing biocides, is the making of informed decisions about
what water treatment regime is applied, and how it should be controlled and monitored.
Selection of an appropriate treatment regime is a complex exercise, which must take into

chlorination can be made on continuous or discontinuous (seasonal) basis depending on many
factors such as meteoclimatic characteristics of the site, water quality, cooling circuit design and
biofouling typology (settlement periods and growth rates).
Mainly the injection takes place in low doses so that the concentration in free chlorine in the
discharge is generally between 0.1 and 0.5 mg/l normally (sporadically 0.7 mg/l). The value of
this limit concentration is set by local regulations.
However, when it reacts with some organic matter, chlorine may lead to the formation of organo
halogenated substances (mainly bromoform in seawater). Some studies nevertheless show that
bromoform concentrations in the plumes of warm water discharges from coastal-sited power
plants remain extremely low (about 15 ¬µg/l).

that the waste gas flow does not have to be stopped during cleaning. Felted, i.e. non-

The majority of emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) in the 
chemical industry sector are diffuse/fugitive emissions or occur during storage, and both sources 
are difficult to measure and quantify [ 15, CEFIC 2012 ]. NMVOC emissions to air by industry 
sector are shown in Figure 1.14. In 2010, 226 installations of the chemical industry sector 
emitted a total of 98.3 kt of NMVOC to air, representing 20.4 % of the total amount of NMVOC

Organic compounds 
Emissions of organic compounds to water by industry sector, reported as total organic carbon 
(TOC), are shown in Figure 1.3. In 2010, 126 installations of the chemical industry sector 
emitted a total of 29.5 kt of TOC to water, representing 4.0 % of the total amount of TOC 
emitted to water by all installations covered by the E-PRTR. The largest share of TOC 
emissions originated from urban waste water treatment plants, followed by intensive 
aquaculture, and then by paper and wood production and processing. Within the chemical 
industry sector, the production of basic organic chemicals was responsible for more than 65 % 
of all TOC</div>

'Facultative' bacteria can get their oxygen by taking dissolved oxygen out of the water or by 
taking it from nitrate molecules. 
Denitrification occurs when oxygen levels are depleted and nitrate becomes the primary oxygen 
source for microorganisms. The process is performed under anoxic conditions, when the 
dissolved oxygen concentration is less than 0.5 mg/l, ideally less than 0.2 mg/l. When bacteria 
break apart nitrate to gain the oxygen, the nitrate is reduced to nitrous oxide (N2O), and, in turn, 
nitrogen gas (N2). Since nitrogen gas has low water solubility, it escapes into the atmosphere as 
gas bubbles. Free nitrogen is the major component of air, thus its release does not cause any 
environmental concern. 
Optimum pH values for denitrification are between 7.0 a</div>

Where large amounts of VOCs are handled, the screening and quantification of emissions from 
the installation by periodic campaigns with optical absorption-based techniques, such as 
Differential absorption light detection and ranging (DIAL) or Solar occultation flux (SOF), is a 
useful complementary technique to the techniques I to III. 
Description 
See Section 4.6.2. 
BAT 6. 
BAT is to periodically monitor odour emissions from relevant sources in 
accordance with EN standards. 
Description 
Emissions can be monitored by dynamic olfactometry according to EN 13725. Emission 
monitoring may be complemented by measurement/estimation of odour exposure or estimation 
of odour impact. 
Applicability  
The applicability is restricted to cases where odour nuisance can be expected or has been 
substantiated.</div>

Biological WWTPs showing relatively high BOD5 and/or TSS values in the effluent (e.g. #25, 
#57, #70, #82, #100) tend to have higher TN emissions. 
Abatement efficiencies for loads reported for 18 biological WWTPs range from 27.8 % to 
95.7 %, but more generally from 43.8 % to 91.9 % (10th to 90th percentile) with a median of

Emissions of lead to water by industry sector are shown in Figure 1.12. In 2010, 47 installations 
of the chemical industry sector emitted a total of 11.8 t of lead to water, representing 6.8 % of 
the total amount of lead emitted to water by all installations covered by the E-PRTR. The largest

underground mining. Within the chemical industry sector, the production of basic inorganic 
chemicals was responsible for more than 75 % of all lead emissions.

Ammonia 
Ammonia emissions to air by industry sector are shown in Figure 1.15. In 2010, 99 installations 
of the chemical industry sector emitted a total of 18.8 kt of ammonia to air, representing 9.4 % 
of the total amount of ammonia emitted to air by all installations covered by the E-PRTR. The 
largest share of ammonia emissions by far originated from the intensive rearing of poultry and 
pigs. Within the chemical industry sector, the production of basic inorganic chemicals and 
fertilisers were together responsible for almost 90 % of all ammonia emissions.

Applicability 
The level of detail and degree of formalisation of the OTNOC management plan will generally 
be related to the nature, scale and complexity of the plant, and the range of environmental impacts 
it may have. 
5.1.2 
Monitoring 
BAT 5. 
For waste water streams identified by the inventory of inputs and outputs 
(see BAT 2), BAT is to monitor key process parameters (e.g. continuous monitoring of waste 
water flow, pH and temperature) at key locations (e.g. at the inlet and/or outlet of the waste 
water pretreatment, at the inlet to the final waste water treatment, at the point where the 
emission leaves the installation).

Hide/skin salting with this method can be done without water cooling, thereby saving 5 litres per 
head (278 l/t carcass). There was no residual salt, saving approximately 0.7 kg per head (0.039 t/t 
carcass). When salting large animal hides, an amount of salt equivalent to about 35 % of their 
weight is used. For example, for a hide weighing 28.5 kg, use 10 kg of salt. For sheepskins, this 
ratio depends on whether the animals are sheared before slaughter; if not, then an amount of salt

Energy efficiency 
BAT 24. 
In order to increase energy efficiency, BAT is to use both of the techniques 
given in BAT 9, if appropriate in combination with multiple-effect evaporators. 
Description 
Multiple-effect evaporators are used to remove water from liquid mixtures generated for example in fat 
melting, rendering, and fishmeal and fish oil production. Steam is introduced in a series of successive 
vessels, each one exhibiting a lower temperature and pressure than the previous one.
