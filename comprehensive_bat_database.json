The following text is a summary of this \nBAT chapter, and the full chapter remains the definitive text for BAT conclusions. \nNo associated energy savings or efficiency values could be derived and/or agreed for \nthis horizontal document. Process-specific BAT for energy efficiency and associated \nenergy consumption levels are given in the appropriate sector-specific (vertical) BREFs. \nBAT for a specific installation is therefore a combination of the specific BAT in the \nrelevant sector BREFs, specific BAT for associated activities that may be found in other \nvertical BREFs (such as the LCP BREF for combustion and steam), and the generic BAT \npresented in this document.  \nThe purpose of the IPPC Directive is to achieve integrated prevention and control of pollution, \nleading to a high level of protection of the environment as a whole, including the \nenergy effici"
